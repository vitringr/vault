# Noise

- [x] Implement any gradient noise
- [x] Optimize a bit

Simplex noise is basically gradient noise, but it "skews" the grid. Instead of rectangles, it makes it a triangular grid. This way there are only 3 corners that need to be interpolated between, instead of 4. After the interpolation it "un-skews" the grid back.

# Electricity

Suggested Order of Learning:

1. DC Circuits (Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Laws, Power)
2. Series/Parallel Resistors & Voltage Dividers
3. Capacitors & Inductors in DC
4. Diodes & Simple Semiconductor Devices
5. AC Basics (if interested in going further)

- Explain accessible science design, which is one of the goals with my website.

- Investing in competition vs learning the art. Differences. How one of the most effective way to produce champions is having a trainer that has mastered the art coaching a student who excels at competition.

- Prejudice is kinda necessary to have.

- Boat paradox & gradients.

- Finish all the wip strategy notes.

- Recency Bias.

- Qualia.

- Educational Psychology.

- Sometimes it's very beneficial to learn from people that
  are still not at the highest level. Link to overfitting.

- Does the world change as a system? Or is it static.

- Cooperation and Game Theory stuff.
