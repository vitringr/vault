# Noise

- [x] Implement any gradient noise
- [ ] Optimize a bit 

Simplex noise is basically gradient noise, but it "skews" the grid. Instead of rectangles, it makes it a triangular grid. This way there are only 3 corners that need to be interpolated between, instead of 4. After the interpolation it "un-skews" the grid back.

# Easing-functions

Visualize the curves with beziers or SVG images.
