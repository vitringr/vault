## Circuits

Electric current is made up of moving electric charges that the battery pushes around the circuit.

For a bulb to light, current must be able to flow through it in a complete loop, starting and ending at the battery.

An obstacle-free route for current that bypasses components is called a short-circuit.

Paths with more resistance receive a smaller share of the current.

In most circuits, the resistance of the wires is small enough that we can ignore it.

A path with less resistance draws more current, so a bulb in this path will be brighter.

When the circuits splits into two paths, so does the current, with more current taking the easier path.

The total current from a battery is not fixed. Circuits with less resistance receive more current.

Not all light bulbs are identical. We can use ammeters to compare them.
