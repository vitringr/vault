### Transformations

#### Translation

For every vector `<x, y>` that defines an image, the rule:

```
<x + a, y + b>
```

results in a **translation** of the image by the vector `<a, b>`.

#### Reflection

## Circuits

Electric current is made up of moving electric charges that the battery pushes around the circuit.

For a bulb to light, current must be able to flow through it in a complete loop, starting and ending at the battery.

An obstacle-free route for current that bypasses components is called a short-circuit.

Paths with more resistance receive a smaller share of the current.

In most circuits, the resistance of the wires is small enough that we can ignore it.

A path with less resistance draws more current, so a bulb in this path will be brighter.

When the circuits splits into two paths, so does the current, with more current taking the easier path.

The total current from a battery is not fixed. Circuits with less resistance receive more current.

Not all light bulbs are identical. We can use ammeters to compare them. An ammeter shows how many amps (A) of current are flowing through a wire. The higher the resistance, the less amps are flowing.

The total current flowing into a split in a circuit must equal the total current flowing out of that split.

Current is made up of moving charges. The number of charges entering a current split must equal the number of charges leaving, so the current entering equals the current leaving.

---

A charge must have the same amount of energy after completing a lap of the circuit - the voltage gained from the battery must equal the total voltage lost to bulbs.

Since a charge must gain and lose the same amount of energy after completing the circuit, that means for a simple circuit the voltage of the battery is equal to the sum of bulb voltages.

---

The brightness of a bulb depends on both current and voltage.

Current determines the number of charges passing through a bulb. Voltage determines how much energy the bulb gets from each charge.

The power output of a bulb depends on the product of current and voltage, and is measured in watts (W).

`Voltage * Current = Power`

`10V * 2A = 20W`

Current gets spread between paths. Voltage does not.

---

The resistance of a bulb is the ratio of voltage to current, and is measured in ohms (Ω).

`Voltage / Current = Resistance`

`8V / 2A = 4Ω`

The more resistance a route has, the less current flows through it.

---

The current through a bulb can be found by dividing voltge by resistance.

`Voltage / Resistance = Current`

`12V / 6Ω = 2A`

---

The combined resistance of two components on the same stretch of wire is the sum of each component's resistance.

`3` bulbs with resistance: `3Ω`, `2Ω`, and `3Ω`.

Battery voltage: `12V`

Total resistance: `3 + 2 + 3 = 8Ω`

Total current: `12V / 8Ω = 1.5A`

---

Each component in a circuit branch adds to that branch's resistance and reduces current.

---

With `n` resistors, each of resistance `RΩ`, are connected in parallel branches, their combined resistance is `RΩ / n`.

Parallel connection: `3Ω`, `3Ω`, and `3Ω`.

`3Ω / 3 = 1Ω` combined resistance.

---

The total current in a circuit depends on battery voltage and the total resistance.

The total current drawn from a battery is equal to its voltage divided by the total resistance of the circuit.

Many components together can have the same effect on current as a single component of equivalent resistance.

---

When the current through bulbs is the same, voltage and resistance are proportional.

A bulb with twice as much resistance will have twice as much voltage.

---

When bulbs with different resistances are placed in the same branch, the one with more resistance is brighter. When placed on parallel branches, the bulb with less resistance is brighter.

---

Knowing resistance, we don't need to know the voltage to predict how current will split.

We can determine which bulb has the greatest power without necessarily knowing voltage or current.

---

A pair of `4Ω` bulbs in parallel branches take the same voltage share as a single `2Ω` bulb.
