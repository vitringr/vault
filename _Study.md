_Basics of Linear Algebra and Trigonometry._

Read the book carefully:

And then maybe watch the things not so carefully:

- [ ] **Trigonometry Index**: https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trigonometry-index.html

- [ ] **3B1B**: The Essence of Linear Algebra (Watch at least 5 videos)

# OpenGL

_Learn OpenGL and Shaders, and probably stop there._

- [ ] https://learnopengl.com/

> "Your main goal at this stage is to understand how GPU rendering works, implement classic algorithms like shadow mapping and deferred rendering, and create your own physically based renderer. We believe that these are the topics which any graphic engineer should understand to be ready for real job in rendering team."

> "Note that even with OpenGL you can write almost everything, including 2D renderer, first-person shooter game or general-purpose game engine. It is okay spending a year on a project which seemed simple at first glance, as long as it helps you to learn and give you a joy."

# 3D Character Animation

_Figure out how to do 3D characters with skeletal animations._

# SDL3 Project Setup

_Use SDL3 with OpenGL to be as cross-platform as possible._
