## Circuits

Electric current is made up of moving electric charges that the battery pushes around the circuit.

For a bulb to light, current must be able to flow through it in a complete loop, starting and ending at the battery.

An obstacle-free route for current that bypasses components is called a short-circuit.

Paths with more resistance receive a smaller share of the current.

In most circuits, the resistance of the wires is small enough that we can ignore it.

A path with less resistance draws more current, so a bulb in this path will be brighter.

When the circuits splits into two paths, so does the current, with more current taking the easier path.

The total current from a battery is not fixed. Circuits with less resistance receive more current.

Not all light bulbs are identical. We can use ammeters to compare them. An ammeter shows how many amps (A) of current are flowing through a wire. The higher the resistance, the less amps are flowing.

The total current flowing into a split in a circuit must equal the total current flowing out of that split.

Current is made up of moving charges. The number of charges entering a current split must equal the number of charges leaving, so the current entering equals the current leaving.
