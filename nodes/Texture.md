# Texture

Digital image, or a set of data, that generally defines how surface details, such as color, patterns, or material properties, are rendered on a 2D or 3D object in relation to its geometry.

---

**Mapping**: Textures are applied (mapped) to the surface of a shapes and polygons. The process is akin to wrapping a physical object in colored paper.

**Color Data**: Textures usually contain RGB(A) color data, encoded in different ways.

**Multitexturing**: Multiple textures can be applied to the same polygon, each for a different purpose.
