# Dunning-Kruger Effect

Cognitive bias about how people with limited competence in a particular domainan misjudge their abilities.

---

Mainly occurs because people misjudge the skill ceiling and depth of the given domain, as well as their position in the domain.

**Overestimation**: People with low competence in a particular area often believe they are much more competent than they actually are.

**Underestimation**: Conversely, highly competent people may underestimate their ability. See [[Impostor Syndrome]].

As an individual acquires more knowledge and expertise, he might recognize the depth of the domain better in order to more accurately assess his own abilities.
