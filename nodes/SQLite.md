# SQLite

[[Relational Database Management System]] that uses [[SQL]] for manipulating data.

---

SQLite is a [[Software Application]], which can also technically be used as [[System Software]] and [[Embedded Software]].

**Lightweight**: Small and efficient for resource-constrained environments. The library is less than `1MB` in size.

**Serverless**: Does not require a separate server process. The database is stored in a single (`.sqlite` or `.db`) local file.

**Raw**: Interacts with the raw filesystem, reading/writing directly to the file.

**Self-contained**: Requires minimal setup. No installation or administration needed. The entire database is a single cross-platform file.

**Zero Configuration**: No need for configuration files or user management.

**Cross-platform**: Works on almost any common platform.

**Open Source**: Free and [[Open Source]].
