# Iterative Development

Cyclical development methodology where a product is built and refined through repeated cycles of [[Prototyping]], testing, and integrating feedback.

---

The idea is to embrace change and reduce risk by testing core assumptions early and often.

Especially applicable to [[Game Development]] and [[Software Development]] in general.

## Core Loop

1. **Design**: Define the goals for the current iteration.
2. **Implement**: Build a functional prototype.
3. **Test**: Test the build to gather feedback.
4. **Evaluate**: Learn from the feedback how to refine the next iteration.
5. Repeat

This loop incrementally improves the product by testing and validating (or invalidating) assumptions.

## Key Principles

**Fail Fast, Learn Fast**: Early, rough prototypes are used to find major flaws quickly and cheaply.

**Continuous Integration**: Feedback is not saved for the end; it's integrated constantly.

**Adaptive Planning**: The final design emerges and evolves based on what is learned, rather than being fully fixed at the start.
