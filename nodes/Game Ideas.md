# From Mods

There are tons of great game ideas from mods/maps of other games.

Some are really good, they just never made it as standalone games.

# Hack & Slash

Learn from Thronefall

See [[Project Spellblade]]

# Bossfights

See [[Project Spellblade]]

# Runner

See [[Project Runner]]

# One Hit

See [[Project Ronin]]

Very simple anticipation-reaction-based mechanics.

Eastern aesthetic would be cool.
