# King and Queen Checkmate

Fundamental [[Checkmate Pattern]] done by a King and Queen.

---

**Pattern**: From any King & Queen vs King position, the basic idea is to box the enemy King into an edge of the board, and then deliver checkmate with the King and Queen together.

**Forced**: Checkmate can always be forced in 10 or less moves in this scenario.

> [!Warning]
> Careful not to force a draw!

**Support the Queen**:
```chesser
fen: 8/8/8/8/8/4K3/4Q3/4k3 b - - 0 1
```

**King area block**:
```chesser
fen: 8/8/8/8/8/4K3/8/Q3k3 b - - 0 1
```
