# Insertion Sort

Stable [[Sorting Algorithm]] that repeatedly swaps the next unsorted element until it reaches the correct position.

---

## Computational Complexity

Insertion sort is simple and efficient for nearly-sorted data, but inefficient for large random/unsorted collections.

**Time Complexity**: `O(nÂ²)` Polynomial
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)` Constant
