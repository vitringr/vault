# Insertion Sort

Stable [[Sorting Algorithm]] that repeatedly swaps the next unsorted element until it reaches the correct position.

---

## Computational Complexity

Insertion sort is simple and efficient for nearly-sorted data, but inefficient for large random/unsorted collections.

**Time Complexity**: `O(nÂ²)` Quadratic
**Space Complexity**: `O(1)` Constant

```c
void insertionSort(int arr[], int size) {
  for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
    int current = arr[i];
    int k = i - 1;

    while (k >= 0 && arr[k] > current) {
      arr[k + 1] = arr[k];
      k--;
    }

    arr[k + 1] = current;
  }
}
```
