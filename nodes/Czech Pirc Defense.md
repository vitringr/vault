**Versatile**: Can be played in almost any game.

## Strategy

**Queen Line**: The Queen can be develiped on `a5`, often pinning the `c3` Knight to the King. This dark diagonal is safe for her, as she can always retreat back to `c7`, where she's controlling the center.

**Center Pawn**: Pinning the Knight puts pressure on the center `e4` pawn.
