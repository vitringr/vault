orientation: black

**Versatile**: Can be played in almost any game.

## Strategy

The general strategy is to:

1. Attempt a trap
2. Control the center
3. Develop pieces

### Queen Line

The Queen can be develiped on `a5`, often pinning the `c3` Knight to the King.

```chesser
fen: rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2pp1n2/q7/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 1
orientation: black
```

**Center Pawn**: Pinning the Knight puts pressure on the center `e4` pawn as it removes its defender.

**Queen Retreat**: If the queen is in any danger, retreat back using the dark diagonal. She is safe on `c7`, also offering center control.
