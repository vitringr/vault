# Multiplicative Inverse

(Reciprocal of a Number)

The multiplicative inverse of a number `n` is a value that, when multiplied by the original number `n`, results in `1`.

---

For a non-zero number `a`, its multiplicative inverse is `1/a`, or `a^-1`.

The multiplicative inverse of a fraction `a/b` is `b/a`.

Multiplying by a number is the same as dividing by its reciprocal and vice versa. See [[Reciprocal Multiplication]].
