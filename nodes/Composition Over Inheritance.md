# Composition Over Inheritance

Software design principle stating that [[Class (OOP)|classes]] should favor code reuse and [[Polymorphism (OOP)|polymorphic]] behavior by their [[Composition (OOP)|composition]], rather than [[Inheritance (OOP)|inheritance]] from a parent class.

_"Ideally all reuse can be achieved by assembling existing components."_

The key idea is to prefer creating smaller, reusable, and interchangeable components instead of building deep and rigid class hierarchies.

Composition promotes [[Modular Design]].
