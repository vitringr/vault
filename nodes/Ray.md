# Ray

Part of a [[Line]] that has one endpoint and extends infinitely in one direction.

---

Defined by its endpoint and any other point on it that indicates its direction.

Has infinite length but is bounded in one direction.

**Notation**: `→AB` denotes the ray starting at point `A` and passing through point `B`.

## Representation

**Parametric Form**: `p(t) = p₀ + tv`, where `p₀` is the endpoint, `v` is the direction vector, and `t` is in the range from `0` to `∞`.
