# JavaScript Control Flow

The order in which instructions in a JavaScript program are executed.

---

**Sequential**: By default, the program runs code from top to bottom. It starts from the firs tline and ends at the last line unless it hits any statement that changes the control flow.

**Conditional**: Conditional statements that evaluate boolean values like `if`, `if...else`, and `switch`.

**Iteration**: Loops can repeat executions multiple times.

**Exceptions**: See [[JavaScript Exceptional Handling]]
