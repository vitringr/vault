# Bounding Sphere

[[Sphere]] that encloses an object.

---

Used in [[Computational Geometry]] as a [[Heuristic]] approximating the geometry of a target object.

## Advantages

Bounding spheres are often used because of their simplicity.

An advantage of the bounding sphere is that it doesn't care about orientation.

Another advantege is that intersections with a sphere are easy to calculate.
