# Castle-based Attack Direction

How castling affects the general direction of attack.

---

When both players castle, it can be either same side, or opposite side.

## Same Side

Generally results in a more quiet game.

Both Kings are protected on the same side, and most exchanges are expected to happen in the center or in the opposite side of the board.

### Shield Storm

There are exceptions, for example a player can choose to do a pawn storm with the pawns that are protecting his King. This can be seen in many [[King's Indian Attack|KIA]]/[[King's Indian Defense|KID]] games for example.

## Opposite

Generally more aggressive and straightforward.

The King is defended on one side, and the opposite side pieces are aligned with the enemy castle.

Since the pieces on the opposite side are aligned with the enemy castle and are probably not needed for defense, they can be fully committed to push the enemy castle.

Opposite side pawns become especially strong as they can be pushed to break the enemy castle, and open up files for the rooks when they are captured.

### Race

Many opposite side castle games are won by the player who reaches the enemy castle first, as he can put pressure that is forced to be defended, or even end the game right there.
