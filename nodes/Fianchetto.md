**Hypermodern Staple**: The fianchetto is a staple of many [[Hypermodernism (Chess)|Hypermodern]] [[Opening (Chess Phase)|Openings]], which often delay direct occupation of the centre.

Regularly occurs in [[Indian Game|Indian games]].

**Bishop**: One of the major benefits of the fianchetto is that it often allows the fianchettoed bishop to become more active.
