# Inequality

Mathematical statement that makes a non-equal comparison between two [[Expression|expressions]].

---

Inequalities can be simplified down to their most basic form.

## Operators

Use the `<`, `>`, and `=` operators

`A < B`: `A` is less than `B`
`A > B`: `A` is greater than `B`
`A <= B`: `A` is less than or equal to `B`
`A >= B`: `A` is greater than or equal to`B`

## Solutions

Inequalities can have any number of solutions. That includes zero solutions, or infinitely many solutions.

To solve an inequality, find the [[Variable|variables]] that make both sides equal.
