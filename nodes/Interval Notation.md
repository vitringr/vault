# Interval Notation

Mathematical notation used to represent a set of numbers between two endpoints.

---

It is a concise way to describe intervals on the [[Number Line]], indicating which numbers are included in a solution set.

The symbols used:

- **Parentheses `()`**: Open & not included. Used when the endpoint is not a part of the interval.
- **Brackets `[]`**: Included & closed. Used when the endpoint is part of the interval.

For example, `[a, b)` means "all numbers `x` such that `a â‰¤ x < b`".
