Design ideas related to gameplay.

**Reward Beautiful Gameplay**: One of the main goals is to [[Reward Beautiful Gameplay]] in a way that makes cheesy gameplay undesirable.

**Flow State**: One of the most difficult yet rewarding gameplay design goals is to enable the player achieve flow state in game.

- The player should be on the edge of challenge, where the game is difficult by default, but not unplayable.
- Smooth control is crucial. The gap between the mind and action should be as small as possible.

**Freedom**: The player is the master of the game and should be free to choose his own playstyle.

- Avoid limiting the player just for the sake of game design. Only guide the player, but let him have his freedom.

**Interactions**: Spells and effects must interact with one another, leading to devastating combinations.

- This should be the incentive of the player to constantly switch spells instead of spamming the same thing over and over again.

**Reward Skill**: The potential skill of the player should be the most overpowered mechanic.

## Tasks

**Health**: Figure out if the player should be able to easily regenerate or not. Ways to heal due to combat are probably the best design choice, as they enable survival via heroic gameplay.
