# The C Programming Language

Notes taken from the book: The C Programming Language (Second Edition)

## Introduction

C is a general purpose programming language.

The language is not tied to any operating system or machine.

**Data Types**: C provides a variety of data types. The fundamental types are characters, and integers and floating-point numbers of several sizes. In addition, there is a hierarchy of derived data types created pointers, arrays, structures, and unions.

**Expressions**: Expressions are formed from operators and operands. Any expression can be a statement.

**Pointers**: Pointers provide for machine-independent address arithmetic.

**Control Flow**: C provides the fundamental control-flow constructions required for well-structured programs: statement grouping, decision making, selecting one of a set of possible cases, looping with the termination test at the top or bottom, and early loop exit.

**Functions**: Functions may return valeus of basic types, structures, unions, or pointers. Any function may be called recursively. Local variables are typically "automatic", or created anew with each invocation. Function definitions may not be nested but variables may be declared in a block-structured fashion. The functions of a C program may exist in separate source files that are compiled separately. Variables may be internal to a function, external but known only within a single source file, or visible to the entire program.

**Preprocessing**: A preprocessing step performs macro substitution on program text, inclusion of other source files, and conditional compilation.
