# JavaScript Indexed Collections

JavaScript data collections accessed using numeric indices.

---

The two main indexed collections are _Arrays_ and _Typed Arrays_.

> [!Note] JavaScript "Array"
> Technically, arrays in JavaScript are not true [[Array|Arrays]] in the traditional sense. Instead, they are objects with special behavior for managing indexed elements.

**Arrays**: General-purpose collection that stores elements of any type, accessed by numeric indices.

**Typed Array**: Specialized collection for handling binary data in fixed-size arrays with a single data type.
