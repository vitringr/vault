# Preserving Attack Complexity

An attacker may avoid exchanges as they reduce the attack complexity.

Exchanging pieces simplifies the position. This simplification may reduce the potential of the attack.

It's impossible to [[Checkmate]] using a single piece. It's possible by using two pieces, and it's made even easier when using more.
