Equivalent to [[Spekingr]].

The word itself is a compound word, very common in Old Norse:

- **speki** (noun): Meaning "wisdom."
- **maðr** (noun): Meaning "man."

**Transliteration**: The `ð` (Eth) symbol in "maðr" is often transliterated as `d` or `th`, so both "spekimadr" and "spekimathr" are valid.
