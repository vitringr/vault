# Computer Memory

The storage of information in [[Computer]] devices.

---

Data is stored as an [[Array]] of [[Binary]] numbers.

Memory is counted in [[Bit|bits]] or [[Byte|bytes]].

## Lifetime

Volatile memory ([[RAM]]) loses data when powered off.

Non-volatile memory (storage) persists without power.

## Hierarchy

Computer memory follows a trade-off between speed, cost, and size.

From the fastest access and smallest size, to the slowest access and biggest size:

**CPU Registers** > **Cache Memory** > **Main Memory** > **Storage**
