# King and Rook Checkmate

Fundamental [[Checkmate Pattern]] done by a King and Rook.

---

**Pattern**: From any King & Rook vs King position, the basic idea is to box the enemy King into an edge of the board, and then deliver checkmate with the King and Rook together.

**Forced**: Checkmate can always be forced in this scenario.

> [!Warning]
> Careful not to force a draw!
