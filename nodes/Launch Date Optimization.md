# Launch Date Optimization

Since the launch date of a product can be one of the most important days, try to optimize it as much as possible.

## Date

Try to figure what the best date is going to be.

Consider as many factors as possible.

**Statistics**: Use statistics to figure out optimal dates and hours.
**Align with events**: Figure out what else is happening and try to use it to your favor.
**Avoid events**: Avoid getting outshined by something else.

## Buildup

Do a solid preparation and buildup leading to the launch date.
