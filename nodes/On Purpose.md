# On Purpose

My thoughs about purpose, [[Ikigai]], and meaning in life.

---

## Singular Purpose

Why only one? Why not many?

When talking about the concept of purpose, people generally tend to think of it as a singular objective:

- "Be the best X"
- "Achieve Y thing"

Beware of the [[Nerd]] mindset.

If purpose is defined as a specific goal in life, then I don't see a reason why it should be only one.

A person can (and probably should) have many goals in life.

Besides, what if you have a single purpose/goal in life and you manage to complete it?
Would that mean that you have achieved everything that you were meant to achieve?
Who's the arbiter of that?

And whata if you fail? Does it mean that your whole life will be a failure if you don't achieve that one goal?
Again, who's to say?

In any case, both win or lose, finding another purpose, or many more, is probably the right thing to do.

## Unknown

You really don't know.

And I think that's fine.

## Types of Purpose

There are different types of purpose in terms of shared objectives.

**Personal**: Your own purpose and objectives.

If you're selfish enough, you stop here.

**Shared**: Collective purpose and objectives concerning your species.

**Universal**: Purpose and objectives concerning the world you live in.

## Finding Purpose

A grind. As usual.

## My Own

**Personal**: Self-development.

Self-development is my primary goal.

I want to learn. As much as I can.
I want to gain and develop all the virtues I'm able to: _clarity_, _enlightenment_, _spirit_, _wisdom_, _discipline_, _knowledge_, _insight_, _honor_, _skill_, _honesty_, _strength_, _will_...
I want to remain _adaptive_, being able to change any of this if I learn that I need to.

I wish for [[Eudaimonia]].

And if I could reach for more than that, then I probably would.

**Shared**: Science. Ethics. Preservation. Enlightenment.

**Universal**: The advancement of consciousness in both quality and quantity.
