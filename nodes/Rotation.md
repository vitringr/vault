# Rotation

[[Rigid Transformation]] that moves space around a fixed point or axis.

---

Every point moves around a circular arc around a fixed center point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D).

Preserves distances, angles, and orientation.

## Representation

2D Representation:

- **[[Rotation Matrix]]**: Standard 2x2 rotation matrix.

3D Representation:

- **[[Rotation Matrix]]**: Standard 3x3 rotation matrix.
- **[[Euler Angles]]**: Represents rotation as three sequential rotations around the primary axes.
- **[[Axis-Angle Representation]]**: Unit vector that describes the axis of rotation and a scalar for the angle magnitude.
- **[[Quaternion]]**: Four-dimensional number system that compactly and robustly represents three-dimensional rotations.
