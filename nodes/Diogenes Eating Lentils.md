# Diogenes Eating Lentils

He was seen by the philosopher Aristippus who was living in richness by flattering the king. Aristippus said:

_"If you would learn to be obedient to the king you would not have to live on crap like lentils."_

Diogenes replied:

_"If you had learned to live on lentils you would not have to flatter kings."_
