# Analysis Paralysis

Inability to make a decision due to overthinking.

---

_"Perfect is the enemy of good."_

_"Good decision now is better than a perfect decision never."_

## Causes

**Perfectionism**: The desire for an ideal outcome can delay an action indefinitely.

**Too Many Choices**: More options can lead to wasted time trying to figure out the best one.

**Fear of Failure**: Worrying about making the wrong decision can prevent any decision at all.

**Prerequisites**: Being stuck in the prerequisite phase, gathering information and resources instead of actually beginning action.

## Effects

**Missed Opportunities**: Delays and inactivity can lead to lost chances.

**Procrastination**: Time wasted on overthinking instead of acting.

**Stress**: Anxiety due to over-analysis, combined with the anxiety of not progressing forward.
