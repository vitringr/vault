# System of Equations

Finite set of equations for which common solutions are sought.

Multiple equations that share the same [[Variable|variables]].

## Solutions Count

**Linear Systems**: A system of [[Linear Equation|Linear Equations]] can have *zero*, *one*, or *infinite* solutions. The [[Graph (Plot)|Graph]] solution to a linear system is the intersection of all lines.

**Linear and Quadratic**: A system with a [[Linear Equation]] and a [[Quadratic Equation]] can have *zero*, *one*, or *two* solutions.

## Solving Methods

**Graphical Method**: Find where the [[Graph (Plot)|Equation Graphs]] intersect. The intersection points are the solutions to the system.

**Substitution**: Solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other equation(s).

**Elimination**: Use addition and subtraction to eliminate variables, making it easier to solve for the remaining ones.

**Scaling**: Involves multiplying an entire equation (both sides) by a non-zero constant. This operation can simplify the solving process.
