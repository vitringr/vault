# Memory Layout

The memory segments of a [[Computer Program]].

---

Computer program memory can be largely categorized into two sections: read-only and read/write.

## Code Segment

(aka. Text Segment)

Contains executable [[Machine Code]] and is generally read-only and fixed size.

## Data Segment

(aka. Global/Static Segment)

Contains static data.

Divided into two parts:

- **Data**: Initialized static data.
- **BSS**: Uninitialized static data.

## Heap Segment
