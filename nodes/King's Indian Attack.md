King's Indian is an adaptive [[Hypermodernism (Chess)|Hypermodern]] opening.

**Mirror**: The White equivalent of [[King's Indian Defense]].

**Consistency**: Can be played in almost any game, regardless of reactions.

## Transpositions

The KIA can be transposed with a plethora of systems involving pawns on `d3` and `e4`.

## Benefits

The King's Indian Attack, [[King's Indian Defense]], and [[Pirc Defense]] share the same structure and concepts.

Since the openers are versatile enough to be played in any game, they allow the player to focus on the same system for both Black and White, reducing the amount of theory that he would have to learn otherwise.
