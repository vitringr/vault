# King's Indian Attack

Classic and versatile opening for White.

Characterized by `Nf3` and a kingside [[Fianchetto]].

**Consistency**: One benefit to this opening is that it can be played basically every game, regardless of reactions.

**Pawn Openings**: The KIA can also be transposed with a plethora of systems involving pawns on `d3` and `e4`.

Mirrors the [[King's Indian Defense]] and [[Pirc Defense]], but for white.
