# King's Indian Attack

[[King's Indian]] opening for White.

Characterized by a kingside [[Fianchetto]] and Knight.

```chesser
fen: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w Qkq - 0 1
orientation: white
```

**Transpositions**: The KIA can be transposed with a plethora of systems involving pawns on `d3` and `e4`.

## Basic Development

**Structure**: The opening idea is to create the King's Indian structure: `Nf3`, `g3`, `Bg2`, castle.

```chesser
fen: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w Qkq - 0 1
orientation: white
```

This can usually be done without much regard to the opponent's moves, with one very common exception - early `e5`.

**Early `e5`**: Whenever the opponent plays `e5`, answer with `d3`. Otherwise, `e5-e6` will endanger your Knight.

```chesser
fen: r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4
orientation: white
```

If it's an unprotected `e5` just capture it with the Knight.
