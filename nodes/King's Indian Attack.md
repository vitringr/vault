# King's Indian Attack

Opening for White characterized by `Nf3`, `Bg2`, and a kingside [[Fianchetto]].

orientation: white
```

**Consistency**: One of the great things about this opening is that it can be played basically every game, regardless of reactions.

**Pawn Openings**: The KIA can also be transposed with a plethora of systems involving pawns on `d3` and `e4`.

Mirrors the [[King's Indian Defense]] and [[Pirc Defense]], but for white.
