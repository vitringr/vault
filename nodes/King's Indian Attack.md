# King's Indian Attack

[[King's Indian]] opening for White.

Characterized by a kingside [[Fianchetto]] and Knight.

```chesser
fen: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w Qkq - 0 1
orientation: white

**Transpositions**: The KIA can be transposed with a plethora of systems involving pawns on `d3` and `e4`.

## Basic Development

**Structure**: The opening idea is to create the kingside King's Indian structure: `Nf3`, `g3`, `Bg2`, castle.

```chesser
fen: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w Qkq - 0 1
orientation: white
```

The `Nf3` opening also denies an immediate `e5`.

**Protected `e5`**: Whenever the opponent plays a protected `e5`, answer with `d3` immediately. Otherwise, `e5-e6` will endanger your Knight.

```chesser
fen: r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4
orientation: white
