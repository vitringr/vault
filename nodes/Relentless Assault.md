# Relentless Assault

Strategy of maintaining continuous, overwhelming offense.

---

**Attrition**: Constant pressure inflicts attrition over time. See [[Attrition Strategy]]

**Forced Error**: Decision-making quality degrades under stress. Everyone is susceptible to mistakes when pressured.

**Tempo**: Opponents can become trapped in a loop of reactive defense cycles, preventing them from initiating their own offense.

**Disrupt**: Prevents the opponent from entering flow state.

**Exhaust**: The cognitive load of constant defensive reaction is greater than that of methodical offense.

**Momentum**: Attacks can create positive feedback loops, leading to more chains of attacks.

**Fear Reduction**: The act of attacking is psychologically empowering. See [[Aggression Over Fear]]
