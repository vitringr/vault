# Generator and Spender Mechanic

Having something that generates a resource, and something else that spends it.

---

Very useful when it comes to designing attack abilities and such.

Instead of using cooldowns or time-based resources, this mechanic can interlock things `A` and `B`, making `A` depend on the usage of `B`.
