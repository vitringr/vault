# Line Segment

Part of a [[Line]] bounded by two distinct endpoints.

---

Contains every point on the line between its endpoints.

Has finite length.

**Length**: The distance between its endpoints `A` and `B`.

**Midpoint**: The point that divides the segment into two equal parts.

See [[Distance Formula]]

## Representation

**Straightforward**: Coordinate endpoints `p₁` and `p₂`.

**Parametric Form**: `p(d) = p₀ + dv`, where `p₀` is the starting coordinate point, `v` is the length & direction vector, and `d` is the delta, usually in the `0` to `1` range.
