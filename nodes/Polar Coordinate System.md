# Polar Coordinate System

#wip
Two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction.

useful to describe coordinates relative to the point of view perspective.

has origin; has only one "polar" axis.

uses distance and angle to describe coordinates.

aliases: basically an infinite amount of coordinates can describe the same point in space. But they can all be thought of as aliases, and all of them can be converted into a single "proper" alias. This way, the bijection of coordinates to points remains.

- Any coordinate that works is okay, but only one is the preferred one to use.

Polar coordinates direcly map to the "direction and magnitude" [[Vector]] interpretation.

## 3D Polar Space

+ distance = Cylindrical

+ angle = Spherical
