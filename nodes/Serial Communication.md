In contrast to [[Parallel Communication]].

## Advantages

Advantages over parallel communication.

**Noise Resistance**: Better performance in electrically noisy environments.

**Signal Integrity**: Maintains quality over long distances.

**Cost Efficiency**: Cables are cheaper, requiring fewer wires and simpler connectors.

**Scalability**: Effective and scalable for both short and long-distance communication.

**Simplicity**: No need for serializers and deserializers and heavy synchronization.
