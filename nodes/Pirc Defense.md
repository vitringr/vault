Pirc Defense is a versatile, [[Hypermodernism (Chess)|Hypermodern]] opening.

**Versatility**: Can be played in almost any game, without much concern about the opponent's opener.

## Transpositions

**King's Indian Defense**: Transposes with the [[King's Indian Defense]]. The difference is that instead of `d4`, White may usually play `e4`, putting pressure on the Knight, to which Black answers with `d6`.

## Variations

[[Pirc Defense - Classical]]

## Strategy

**Defense**: Black trades early center control for a solid kingside setup.

**Fianchetto**: Black uses kingside [[Fianchetto]] to `g7`.

**Direction**: Black usually aims to attack on the kingside or center.

**Queenside Stall**: If the attack is targeting the kingside, the queenside can be stalled with pawns.
