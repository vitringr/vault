# Black Dog Story

Driving to work, I saw a dog that had just been hit by a car.

The sight was horrific.

There was blood all over it, all over the ground, and the dog was doing seizure-like motions and there were terrible sounds.

I stopped my car and went to help.

The driver was some woman that had just hit it.

There was also another guy that wanted to help. Lets call him Beard. He was really worried about the dog.

I gave the phone of a veterinarian I know to Beard so that he can call and ask if we can drive the dog there.

While Beard was talking, I took a blanket from the woman and somehow managed to wrap it underneath the dog without moving it too much.

The dog tried to bite me, but its jaw was broken.

Beard said that the veterinarian cannot do first aid, but there's a clinic nearby.

The clinic's name was "101 Dalmatinci".

Some stupid old women came to the scene yapping about driving and whatnot. I told them to either be of help or to fuck off otherwise.

We lifted the dog and put it inside of my trunk.

My hands were covered in blood.

The woman said that she knows that clinic and she'll come with me.

I thought about exchanging phone numbers with her, but in the rush I didn't. Mistake in hindsight.

We started driving to the clinic.

I wrote the name of the clinic in my phone location app.

There was a lot of traffic, but I showed my bloody hand to some guy and he let me take his place and go first. Good man.

While driving, we suddenly split. My location made me take a right turn, while the woman continued forward.

When I reached the location destination, there was no veterinary clinic in the vicinity.

The dog in my trunk being in agony, making these terrible noises, howling, seizuring, and everything smelled like blood.

And I'm driving in circles because there's no veterinary clinic there.

I stop and ask some people if they know where the clinic is - nobody knows anything.

Slight panic. Felt like I fucked up big time.

I saw a girl with a pitbull on a leash and thought that she might know.

She did. She told me that the clinic is just around the corner, but it's a one-way street, and I'm on the wrong side of traffic.

Fuck it.

There were a bunch of cars with angry drivers inside that had to deal with me being in the wrong lane, but whatever.

Found the clinic!

I parked my car and rushed to the clinic. The door was locked. SHIT. But wait, there was another door. Was that even a clinic? Or some dog food shop? When I saw that there's a doctor inside I felt kind of relieved.

Told the doctors there's a hit dog in my trunk.

Me and the doctor took the dog to the medical room.

While sitting outside, I told one of the doctors that I couldn't find the place, and that me and the woman responsible for the hit had split.

They told me that the current clinic is called "Paradise", which is a private clinic.

The one I was looking for is actually called "101 Lubimci" instead of "101 Dalmatinci".

Either me or Beard got the name wrong.

The location for "101 Dalmatinci" actually led me to a kindergarden in the area with the same name.

What a fuck up, lol.

But the dog is being treated, which is all that really matters.

Since I was of no use in the clinic, I went to the other clinic to search for the woman.

By the time I got there, the woman had already left.

The receptionist was a dumb whore and she was intentionally of no help at all.

Decided to drive back to the place of incident, to see if the woman is still there or something.

Nope, only the blood on the ground remained.

Went back to the clinic and waited.

There was no way of contacting the woman now.

But at least I could try to contact Beard to tell him the dog is being treated.

Called the veterinarian and asked him to give me the phone numbers that had called him around the time of incident.

He gave me a few numbers, and I found Beard. Told him that the dog is in good hands. He seemed relieved.

The doctors of the clinic were great.

The dog was fucked up bad. Broken jaw, broken legs, blood everywhere.

Payed the clinic for the first day of treatment.

Some girl that was listening to the conversation decided to pay for the next day herself. Good person.

Later that night one of the doctors called me to tell me the dog is getting better.
