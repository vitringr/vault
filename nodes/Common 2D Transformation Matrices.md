## Identity matrix

Right remains right, up remains up.

```
1   0

0   1
```

## Reflection in the `𝑦`-axis

Right has become left, up remains up.

```
-1  0

0   1
```

## Reflection in the `𝑥`-axis

Right remains right, up has become down.

```
1   0

0   -1
```

## Rotation by `180°`

Right has become left, up has become down.

```
-1  0

0   -1
```

## Reflection in the line `𝑦 = 𝑥`

Right has become up, up has become right.

```
0   1

1   0
```

## Rotation by `90°` anticlockwise

Right has become up, up has become left.

```
0   -1

1   0
```

## Rotation by `90°` clockwise

Right has become down, up has become right.

```
0   1

-1  0
```

## Reflection in the line `𝑦 = −𝑥`

Right has become down, up has become left.

```
0   -1

-1   0
```

## Scaling by scale factor `𝑎` in the `𝑥` direction

Right is multiplied by `a`, up remains up.

```
a   0

0   1
```

## Scaling by scale factor `𝑎` in the `𝑦` direction

Right remains right, up is multiplied by `a`.

```
1   0
0   a
```

## Scaling by scale factor `𝑎` from the origin

Right is multiplied by `a`, up is multiplied by `a`.

```
a   0

0   a
```

## Scaling by scale factor `𝑎` for `𝑥` and `b` for `y`

Right is multiplied by `a`, up is multiplied by `b`.

```
a   0
0   b
```
