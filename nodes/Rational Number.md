# Rational Number

Any [[Real Number]] that cannot be expressed as the fraction/quotient of two [[Integer]] numbers.

---

Numbers like `1/2 (0.5), 1/3 (0.33...), 4/3 (1.33...)`, ..., and so on.

They are probably called _rational numbers_ as they fit in the [[Number Line]] in obvious places.

**Notation**: The set of all rational numbers is denoted by the bold **`Q`** symbol.
