# Circle

Set of points that are all the same distance `R` from a given center point in a 2D plane.

---

`x² + y² = 1`

The distance `R` between any point of the circle and the centre is called the _radius_ of the circle.

The line segment connecting two points of the circle and passing through the centre is called the _diameter_ of the circle.

**Diameter**: `D = 2R`

**Area**: `A = πR²`

**Circumference**: `C = 2πR` or `C = τR` or `C = πD`
