# Circle

Set of points that are all the same distance `r` from a given center point in a 2D plane.

---

The distance `r` between any point of the circle and the centre is called the _radius_ of the circle.

The line segment connecting two points of the circle and passing through the centre is called the _diameter_ of the circle.

**Implicit Equation**: `x² + y² - r² = 0`

**Diameter**: `D = 2r`

**Area**: `A = πr²`

**Circumference**: `C = τr` or `C = 2πr` or `C = πD`
