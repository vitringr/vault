# Linear Combination

The construction of a new [[Vector]] by scaling and adding a given set of vectors.

---

Fundamental operation in [[Linear Algebra]] where a new vector is created by taking several other vectors, scaling each one by a [[Scalar]], and then adding the results together.

Given a set of vectors `{v₁, v₂, v₃}` in a [[Vector Space]] `V` and a set of scalars `{c₁, c₂, c₃}`, the vector `y` defined by the sum: `y = c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + c₃v₃` is called a _linear combination_ of the vectors `{v₁, v₂, v₃}`. The scalars `{c₁, c₂, c₃}` are called the _weights_ or _coefficients_ of the linear combination.

**Span**: The set of all possible linear combinations between a set of input vectors is called the _span_ of those vectors.
