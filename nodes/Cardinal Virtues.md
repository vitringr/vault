# Cardinal Virtues

The four virtues of mind and character in both classical [[Philosophy]] and [[Christianity|christian]] theology.

**Prudence**: The ability to navigate complex situations and discern right from wrong.

**Fortitude**: The ability to confront fear, difficulty, uncertainty, and intimidation.

**Justice**: Treating others fairly and seeking the common good.

**Temperance**: The practice of self-discipline and moderation.

They are called "cardinal" because it is assumed that all other virtues fall under them and originate from them.
