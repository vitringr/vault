# Basis Vectors

(Coordinate Axes Vectors)

Set of [[Vector|Vectors]] that define a [[Coordinate System]] for a [[Vector Space]].

---

Basis vectors are the fundamental building blocks for constructing any other vector in the space.

Any vector in the space can be expressed as a [[Linear Combination]] of the basis vectors.

**Linear Independence**: Basis vectors must be [[Linear Independence|Linearly Independent]] of each other, meaning that no basis vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.

**Full Span**: Basis vectors must span the entire vector space.

**Dimensions**: The number of basis vectors is the dimension of the vector space.

**Coordinate System**: Basis vectors define the coordinate system of the space. Changing the basis vectors changes how coordinates are interpreted.

**Transformation Core**: Any [[Linear Transformation]] can be expressed as an operation that changes the basis vectors of a space.

**Orthogonal**: In general, it is prefered for the basis vectors to be orthogonal, although this is not a strict requirement. When the basis vectors are orthogonal, the coordinates are decoupled.
