# Basis Vectors

(Coordinate Axes Vectors)

Fundamental [[Vector]] building blocks for a [[Vector Space]]

---

Set of vectors that define a [[Coordinate System]] for a [[Vector Space]].

**Span**: Basis vectors span the entire vector space.

**Basis**: Any vector can be expressed as a scaled sum of the basis vectors. The components of this vector are the scaling factors.

**Dimensions**: The number of basis vectors is the dimension of the vector space.

**Linearly Independent**: Basis vectors must be linearly independent of each other, meaning that no basis vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.

**Coordinate System Definition**: Basis vectors are the abstract definition of a coordinate system. Changing the basis vectors changes how coordinates are interpreted.

- They provide a reference frame that allows the definition of coordinates to every vector in the space.

**Transformation Core**: All linear transformations (rotation, scaling, shearing) can be understood as operations that change the basis vectors of a space.
