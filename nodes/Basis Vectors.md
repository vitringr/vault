# Basis Vectors

(Coordinate Axes Vectors)

Set of [[Vector|Vectors]] that define a [[Coordinate System]] for a [[Vector Space]].

#wip edit this; sucks

The basis vectors form the fundamental building blocks that can describe any vector within a vector space.

**Span**: Basis vectors span the entire vector space.

**Basis**: Any vector can be expressed as a scaled sum of the basis vectors. The components of this vector are the scaling factors.

**Dimensions**: The number of basis vectors is the dimension of the vector space.

**Linearly Independent**: Basis vectors must be linearly independent of each other, meaning that no basis vector can be written as a linear combination of the others.

**Coordinate System Definition**: Basis vectors are the abstract definition of a coordinate system. Changing the basis vectors changes how coordinates are interpreted.

- They provide a reference frame that allows the definition of coordinates to every vector in the space.

**Transformation Core**: Any [[Linear Transformation]] (rotation, scaling, shearing) can be understood as an operation that changes the basis vectors of a space.
