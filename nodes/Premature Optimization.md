# Premature Optimization

> Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.

## Bottleneck

_"The chain is only as strong as its weakest link."_

If a system is spending 90% of its resources in function `A`, then focus on optimizing function `A` before others.
