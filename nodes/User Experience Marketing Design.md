# User Experience Marketing Design

Design the marketing process as a full user experience from start to finish.

---

Think about the whole user experience as a step-by-step path or lifecycle beginning from the moment they are made aware about the product.

## Example Though Process

Put yourself in the user perspective and be curious.

_User are made aware of product._

- How were they made aware of it?
- How did it catch their attention?
- What would be their first impression?
- What would they remember out of it?

_Users search for the product._

- What would they search for?
- Where would they search at?
- What other things will they find?

_Users land at the product headquarters._

- What's the first thing that grabs attention?
- Is it easy and intuitive to buy the product?
