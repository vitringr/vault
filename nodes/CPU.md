# CPU

The primary processor of a [[Computer]] responsible for executing [[Computer Program]] instructions.

---

**Core Architecture**: CPUs have fewer, more powerful cores optimized for low-latency, serial processing.

**instruction Set**: Executes instructions defined by its architecture.

**Control Unit (CU)**: Decodes and executes instructions, directing data flow between components.

**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs mathematical and logical operations.

**Clock Speed**: Determines how many instructions a CPU can execute per second, measured in GHz.
