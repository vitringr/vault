# Data Structure

Data organization and storage format chosen for efficient data access and management.

---

Data structures are the collection of data values, their arrangement in memory, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Data structures serve as the basis for [[Abstract Data Type|Abstract Data Types]]. The ADT _defines the logical form_ of the data. The data structure _implements the physical form_ of the data.
