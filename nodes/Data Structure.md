# Data Structure

The implementation of an [[Abstract Data Type]].

---

Specialized format for data organization, storage, processing, and access.

Data structures are the collection of data values, their arrangement in memory, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

**ADT Implementation**: An [[Abstract Data Type]] _defines the logical form_ of the data. The data structure _implements the physical form_ of the data.

## Common Data Structures

- [[Array]]
- [[Linked List]]
- [[Queue]]
- [[Stack]]
- [[Hash Table]]
