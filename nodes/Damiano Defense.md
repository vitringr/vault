# Damiano Defense

Weak chess opening, often used by beginners, beginning with: `e4 e5` `Nf3 f6?`.

---

```chesser
fen: rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3
```

The counter to that opening is `Nxe5!`.

This leads to loss of material for black, or even a [[Checkmate]].

```chesser
fen: rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3
```

The Knight opens the light diagonal for the Queen, which can check the King and and win from there.
