# Chess Theory

Theory about the game of chess, commonly divided into the three [[Chess Phases]].

---

There is a large body of theory regarding how the game should be played in each of these phases, especially the [[Opening (Chess Phase)|Opening]] and [[Endgame (Chess Phase)|Endgame]].

Due to its raw complexity and variety, there is less theory about the [[Middlegame (Chess Phase)|Middlegame]] compared to the other two.
