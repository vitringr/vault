# Integer

Any whole [[Number]].

---

The set of integers consist of the [[Natural Number|natural numbers]] (`1`, `2`, `3`, ...), their negatives (`-1`, `-2`, `-3`, ...), and zero (`0`).

**Properties**: Integers are closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Division does not always result in an integer.

**Notation**: `Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}`
