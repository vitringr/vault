# Scaling Knowledge Problem

There was a time in the past when a single person could know everything about a science, or even multiple sciences. You can imagine someone back then knowing everything about, for example, mathematics. Today, this is unfeasible. Now, one can barely master a single branch of mathematics, let alone all of mathematics or multiple sciences.

Excelling in a science is becoming more difficult, as there is far more to know compared to the past. In earlier times, knowing basic algebra and geometry might have sufficed for a mathematician. Today, it’s expected that every student learns those early on.

When my grandmother was young, the local priest in her village was considered a wise man because he was the only one who could read and write. As a result, he was also the village teacher. Back then, being able to read and write was something special, unlike today.

Sciences develop exponentially, but humans have both hard and soft limits—lifespan, memory, intelligence, the time and effort it takes to learn something new, etc.

Sometimes it is necessary to fully grasp a subject in order to contribute to it. But this becomes increasingly challenging. If someone is at the forefront of a field and adds new knowledge, others may need to learn everything so far just to be able to contribute further. As a result, the bar keeps getting raised higher, potentially creating an almost unreachable limit.

## Possible Solutions

**Abstraction**: Focusing on broader knowledge and clarity instead of focusing on details.

**Teamwork**: Separating the work between individuals, each focusing on a smaller part of the bigger problem.

**Artificial Intelligence**: Delegating work and research to minds that are not as bound by lifespan and memory.
