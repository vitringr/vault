Can be defined by two distinct points.

Extends infinitely in both directions.

Has zero curvature.

See [[Linear Equation]]

## Representation

See also the [[Ray]] and [[Line Segment]] representation methods.

**Implicit Form**: `ax + by + c = 0`

**Slope-Intercept Form**: `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the [[Slope]] of the line, and `b` is the y-intercept.

### Special Cases

- **Vertical line**: `x = c` (undefined slope)
- **Horizontal line**: `y = c` (zero slope)
