# Line

Straight one-dimensional figure with infinite length.

---

_"breadthless length"_

Can be defined by two distinct points.

Extends infinitely in both directions.

Has zero curvature.

See [[Linear Equation]]

## Representation

**Standard Form**: `ax + by = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants.

**Implicit Form**: `ax + by + c = 0`

**Slope-Intercept Form**: `y = mx + b` where `m` is the [[Slope]] of the line, and `b` is the y-intercept.

### Special Cases

- **Vertical line**: `x = c` (undefined slope)
- **Horizontal line**: `y = c` (zero slope)
