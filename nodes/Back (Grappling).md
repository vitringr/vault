# Back (Grappling)

If you have to choose between upper-body vs lower-body controls, it seems that upper-body seatbelt is better at controlling and regaining the back position.

If you only have upper-body control and no hooks, then being on the overhook (choking) side seems better.

Having lower-body control, try to go for body triangle variations.

Finish from seatbelt (overhook), seatbelt (underhook), or double overhook.

Prefer the underhook seatbelt for systematic finishes.

Use the overhook seatbelt and the double overhook for more direct and aggressive finishes.
