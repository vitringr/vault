# Quicksort

Efficient unstable [[Sorting Algorithm]] that uses [[Recursion]] and the [[Divide and Conquer]] strategy.

---

1. Choose a "pivot" element from the collection.
2. Partition the collection into two sub-collections using the pivot.
3. Recursively sort the sub-collections.

## Computational Complexity

As the name implies, Quicksort, on average, is one of the fastest sorting algorithms.

**Average Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` Linearithmic
**Worst Time Complexity**: `O(nÂ²)` Polynomial

**Average Space Complexity**: #wip
**Worst Space Complexity**: #wip
