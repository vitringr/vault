# Affine Transformation

Geometric transformation that preserves points, straight lines, and planes, but does not necessarily preserve the origin.

An affine transformation is a [[Linear Transformation]] followed by a translation.

Any linear transformation is an affine transformation (with no translation portion), but not all affine transformations are linear transformations.
