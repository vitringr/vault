# Euclidean Vector

Geometric object that has magnitude and direction.

---

Frequently represented by a directed line segment.

**Magnitude**: the length or size of the vector.
**Direction**: indicates where the vector is pointing.

The direction can also be represented by an angle.

Vectors are a way of describing movement with math.

**Etymology**: A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point `A` to the point `B`. The Latin translation of 'vector' means 'carrier'.
