# Ommision Bias

Tendency to judge harmful actions as worse, or less moral, than equally harmful inactions.

---

Actions are often seen as more deliberate and therefore more blameworthy than inactions.

Inactions create a psychological distance from the consequences, making them seem less direct or intentional.
