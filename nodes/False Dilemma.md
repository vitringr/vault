# False Dilemma

(False Dichotomy, False Binary)

Logical fallacy asserting that one among a number of alternatives must be true.

Premise that mistakenly limits what options are available.

---

The fallacy often presents opposing options as the only possible choices, of which one must be true.
This may not be the case, as:

- There may be other alternative choices available.
- The choices may be compatible to one another.

## Example

**False Dicothomy**: _"Shall I be wise and great, or rich and powerful?"_

**Compatibility**: Falsely asserts that being "_wise and great_" is in opposition to being "_rich and powerful_", when in fact one can be **both** at the same time.

**Alternatives**: Also falsely asserts that one is either "_wise and great_" or "_rich and powerful_", when in fact one can be **neither** of those.
