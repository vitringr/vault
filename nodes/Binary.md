# Binary

The representation of numbers using two symbols.

---

Typically uses `0` and `1`.

A single binary digit is called a [[Bit]].

Because of its simplicity, the binary system is fundamental in [[Informatics]], [[Computer Science]], [[Boolean Algebra]], and [[ICT]].

Binary numbers can be expressed as the combination of powers of 2. Every `ⁿ` in `2ⁿ` is the next radix, starting from `2¹`.

| Base-10 | Base-2  |
| ------- | ------- |
| `0`     | `0`     |
| `1`     | `1`     |
| `2`     | `10`    |
| `3`     | `11`    |
| `4`     | `100`   |
| `5`     | `101`   |
| `6`     | `110`   |
| `7`     | `111`   |
| `8`     | `1000`  |
| `9`     | `1001`  |
| `10`    | `1010`  |
| `11`    | `1011`  |
| `12`    | `1100`  |
| `13`    | `1101`  |
| `14`    | `1110`  |
| `15`    | `1111`  |
| `16`    | `10000` |
| `17`    | `10001` |
| `18`    | `10010` |
| `19`    | `10011` |
| `20`    | `10100` |
