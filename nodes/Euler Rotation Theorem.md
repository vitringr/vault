# Euler Rotation Theorem

In three-dimensional space, any displacement of a rigid body such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the fixed point.

---

_One fixed point, one axis, one angle._

The sum of all rotations is equal to a single rotation.

No matter how you twist a rigid body around a fixed point, you can always get to the final position with just one single rotation about a specific axis.
