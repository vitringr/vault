# Project Spellblade - Story

The goal is to exit/escape/return.

The world, like a function, to return the complete self.

Some know this, and split into factions.

One faction wants to complete the world as the main purpose of it.

The other faction does not. It wants to preserve the world and the immortality it provides.

Sage knows the answers.

He knows that even the factions are by design.

To complete the world, one must be ready.

To be ready, he must complete all challenges.

Many have tried, many have failed, many have abandoned.

Another stands in the end, to defend the last gate.

He who defeats him can either choose to complete the world, or reset all gates and defend them himself.
