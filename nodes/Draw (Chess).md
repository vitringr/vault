The ways a chess game can be drawn:

- **Mutual Agreement**: When both players agree to draw at any point during the game.
- **Stalemate**: See [[Stalemate (Chess)]]
- **Threefold Repetition**: When the same set of moves is repeated three times.
- **Fifty-Move Rule**: After 50 consecutive moves are made without any pawn movement or capture.
- **Perpetual Check**: If one player can continuously check the opponent without leading to any progress.
- **Insufficient Material**: When neither player has enough material to be able to deliver [[Checkmate]].
- **Impossibility of Checkmate**: If it's not theoretically possible for any player to deliver checkmate.
