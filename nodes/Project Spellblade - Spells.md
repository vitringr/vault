# Project Spellblade - Spells

Player spells, effects, and passives.

**UNDECIDED**: Currently brainstorming possibilities.

---

Terminology:

- **Spells**: Direct cast activation spells.
- **Effects**: Cast after-effects for a duration.
- **Passives**: Permanently persisting effects.

Additions to spells and effects will be added outside of gameplay. Think of talent trees related to spells, as well as generic character talent trees.

## Spells

**Fireball**: Mandatory. Classic fireball projectile that hurts and burns.

**Dash**: Quick but short dash. Could include i-frames.

**Shield**: Short-lived barrier. Can be upgraded for projectile deflection and such.

## Effects

### Weapon Effects

Mandatory weapon enchancements.

**Flaming Weapon**: Classic and self-explanatory.

**Shield-Breaker**: Bonus damage against shields and barriers (if the game features any).

### Armor Effects

Defensive armor effects.

**Elemental Ward**: Resistance against specific element.

### Other

**Sprint**: Short-duration and constantly fading sprint.

## Passives

Passives are split into different categories. Think of classic talent trees:

- Generic Tree
- Spell Tree

**Windfury**: Weapon double-attack chance.
