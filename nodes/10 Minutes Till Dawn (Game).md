# 10 Minutes Till Dawn (Game)

Aesthetic [[Bullet Hell]] survivors-like game.

[Demo](https://flanne.itch.io/10-minutes-till-dawn)

---

Limited thus recognizable color palette.

Simple 2D sprites but with consistent visual cues and good polish.

**More Choice**: The runs are less random compared to other similar games. Every level-up offers one of `5` upgrades (instead of the usual `3`), as well as a reroll.

- Allows one to choose the playstyle of the run without being as dependant on RNG.

**Mechanics**: Apart from movement, the game includes aiming (with manual shooting) and reload, as well as passive (automatic) attack abilities. #wip
