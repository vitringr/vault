# Sorting Algorithm

[[Algorithm]] designed to sort elements in a [[Data Structure]] in a specific order.

---

The goal is to organize data for efficient searching, analysis, or storage.

**Stability**: Sorting algorithms are _stable_ if they preserve the relative order or equal elements, and are _unstable_ if they don't.

## Common Algorithms

[[Bubble Sort]]
[[Selection Sort]]
[[Insertion Sort]]
[[Quicksort]]
[[Counting Sort]]
