# Judgement of Habit

For skills that take time and effort to develop, people should be judged based on their habits, as those habits represent the actual time and effort invested in cultivating such skills.

## Young Talent

When I was a kid, I used to value talent much more than I do now.
Part of the reason was that the people I interacted and competed with were mostly children, too.
Talent plays a huge role when children compete. This is because they haven't had the time to invest in developing certain skills, so talent often becomes the most significant factor.

## The Talent Ceiling

However, talent only gets you so far.
I would define this limitation as the "talent ceiling," meaning the maximum level one can reach with talent alone. For some skills, talent is more advantageous than for others. But in my experience - based on the skills I’ve been interested in learning - talent alone cannot elevate someone to the highest competitive levels.

## Kaizen - Sustained Effort

See [[Kaizen]]

Some skills have such a high skill ceiling that talent alone is nowhere near enough to achieve proficiency.
This is where Kaizen comes in. By Kaizen, I refer to the concepts of continuous improvement: time and effort, hard work, dedication, and all the associated qualities.

The level of Kaizen someone has for a skill can often be deduced from their habits.
Habits are the things we do daily - the real, tangible time and effort spent developing a skill. Kaizen is intrinsically tied to habits and daily practices.

## Judgement

I find myself increasingly judgmental of people based on their habits and daily actions.

This judgment can go in either direction.

For instance, if someone hasn’t practiced a particular skill consistently, it’s reasonable to conclude they haven’t surpassed their "talent ceiling." For activities with skill ceilings far beyond what talent alone can achieve, a lack of sustained effort (or Kaizen) makes it unlikely they will ever reach a high level.

Conversely, if someone practices a skill consistently, I would wager that, given enough time, they will steadily improve—even if their starting point isn’t particularly remarkable.

Ultimately, skill level is primarily a result of sustained effort. This must be the main and most relevant measure of assessment. Everything else is just smoke and mirrors.

## Conclusion

Think deeply and be very selective when building your habits. Do it like your life depends on it, because it just might.

"We first make our habits, then our habits make us."
