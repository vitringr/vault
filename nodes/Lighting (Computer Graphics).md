# Lighting (Computer Graphics)

Encompasses the range of techniques used to simulate light within [[Computer Graphics]].

---

Lighting models simulate how light interacts with surfaces to provide crucial visual effects like shape, depth, color, spatial relationships, material, and so on.

Specular Reflection:

- Phong model
- Blinn-Phong model

Specular reflection is like a mirror, reflecting light in a direction.

Diffuse


---

Specular light wants to know the location of the viewer, to see how close the eye is to the direction of the perfect mirror bounce.

For diffuse the location of the viewer is not relevant.
