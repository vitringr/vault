# Vector Abstraction

The definition of [[Vector]] can be somewhat abstract.

_"Multidimensional Quantity."_

Vectors in different contexts:
- In the context of [[Physics]], a vector is an 'arrow in space' with direction and magnitude, that happens to have a nice numeric representation.
- In the context of [[Computer Science]], a vector is an ordered list of numbers, that happens to have a nice geometric interpretation.

The wisdom is to use [[Abstraction]] and interpret vectors in any way that is useful.
