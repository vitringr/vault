# Linear Transformation

(Linear Map)

[[Morphism]] of a [[Vector Space]] into another.

---

**Function**: Takes a [[Vector]] as input, and returns a vector as output, while respecting the underlying core structure of the vector space.

**Geometric Interpretation**: In [[Geometry]], linear transformations often correspond to operations such as _rotation_, _scaling_, _reflection_, _shearing_, _projection_, or any combination between them.

## Requirements

**Preserved Origin**: Linear transformations must preserve the zero vector (`<0, 0>`) as zero vector.

**Lines Remain Lines**: Straight lines must not be curved after the map. They need to remain straight.

## Examples

- **Rotation**: Spins vectors around the origin by a given angle.
- **Scaling**: Stretches or shrinks vectors along axes.
- **Shear**: #wip
- **Projection**: "Flattens" vectors onto a line or plane.
- **Zero Map**: Sends every vector to the zero vector origin.
- **Identity**: Leaves every vector unchanged.
