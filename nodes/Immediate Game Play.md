# Immediate Game Play

The possibility of immediately playing the game without prerequisites and setup.

---

If possible, it is nice to be able to just quickly play the game.

- Maybe the player doesn't have much time?
- Maybe they want to just get a qucik round in?
- Maybe they want to demonstrate to someone else?
- Maybe they want to quickly test something?

## Examples

### Good

**[[Minesweeper]]**: Can instantly start a game and leave (or lose) whenever.

**[[Quake]]**: Can quickly start a bot match with like 5 clicks and no waiting.

**[[Heartstone]]**: Can find and start a match relatively fast.

### Bad

**[[DotA]]**: You need to wait a lot before starting a game, and it may take a while to finish.
