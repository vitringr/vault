# Adaptive Volatility

Strategically modulating between order and chaos.

_"Simplify when ahead. Complicate when behind."_

---

**Terminology**: The term _volatility_ refers to things such as _risk_, _complexity_, _chaos_, or _randomness_, depending on the context.

## Concept

Volatility can be increased or decreased strategically.

In a stable and predictable environment, the player with the advantage is likely to maintain it. In a chaotic and unpredictable environment, outcomes become more random, allowing for comeback opportunities.

- **When Ahead**: Decrease volatility.
- **When Behind**: Increase volatility.

The basic idea is that if you are ahead, you're already winning, so it's a good idea to be conservative and keep everything as it is. However, if you're behind, you're already losing, so it's better to increase the volatility, allowing more change to happen.

## Time

This principle can be amplified over time due to compounding effects.

The state can become increasingly better, or increasingly worse over time.

Remain in good positions as long as possible to benefit from positive compounding. Exit bad positions as soon as possible to avoid negative compounding.

## Examples

**[[Chess]]**: The classic advice [[Exchange When Ahead]] is a direct application. The winning player wants to exchange pieces in order to simplify the game. The losing player wants to avoid these exchanges in order to keep the game complex and opportunistic.

**[[Grappling]]**: Dominant positions allow for continuous pressure and attacking opportunities over time. The dominant player would generally try to slow down and hold these positions, while the losing player tries to force movement and scramble out of them.

**[[RTS]]**: The player with an economic lead can press their advantage with cost-effective trades and map control. His opponent can use aggressive, unorthodox, high-risk, or even desperate tactics in order to level the playing field.
