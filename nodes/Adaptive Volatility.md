# Adaptive Volatility

Shift between order and chaos based on circumstances.

_"Simplify when ahead. Complicate when behind."_

---

The term _volatility_ can refer to _risk_, _complexity_, _chaos_, _randomness_, depending on the context.

**Concept**: In strategy, volatility can be increased or decreased in order to gain an advantage.

- **When Ahead**: decrease volatility.
- **When Behind**: increase volatility.

The basic idea is that if you are ahead, you're already winning, so it's probably good to be conservative and keep the state as it is. However, this also applies in reverse. If you're behind, you're already losing, so it's probably better to increase the volatility in order to change the losing state.

**Time**: This strategy can become even more pronounced when there is time involved.

Sometimes positions can get increasingly better or worse depending on the time spent there. This makes the concept even more effective, as it's decisive to remain in good positions as much as possible, or get out of bad positions as soon as possible.

## Examples

**[[Grappling]]**: It's often a good idea to play winning positions conservative in order to keep them. It's also common to risk and scramble to get out of bad positions.

**[[Chess]]**: [[Exchange When Ahead|Exchanging pieces when ahead]] is a common and fundamental strategy.

**[[RTS]]**: The winning player would often choose to play conservatively, while the losing player would attempt volatile and risky play, for example trying to force all-in scenarios.
