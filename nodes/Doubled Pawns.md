# Doubled Pawns

Pawns of the same color on the same file.

---

Can only occur via pawn capture.

**Weakness**: Doubled pawns are often considered a structural weakness because:

- They cannot defend each other.
- The rear pawn is blocked by the front pawn and cannot advance.
- One enemy pawn on the same file can block both doubled pawns.

**Open Files**: Doubled pawns create open files which can be an advantage. Rooks and Queens can use those open files.
