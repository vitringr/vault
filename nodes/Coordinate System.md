# Coordinate System

System of coordinates that determine the position of abstract elements in an abstract space.

---

**Coordinates**: In general, coordinates are numbers that represent distances/relations between elements and some origin.

**Uniqueness**: Each point in space should correspond to a unique set of coordinates, and each valid set of coordinates should specify a unique point. See [[Bijection]].

The use of coordinate systems allows for a bridge between [[Geometry]] and [[Algebra]].

Common coordinate systems:

- [[Number Line]]
- [[Cartesian Coordinate System]]
- [[Polar Coordinate System]]
