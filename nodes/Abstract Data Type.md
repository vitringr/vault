# Abstract Data Type

Logical model for a [[Data Structure]], defining its behavior and properties independently of its implementation.

---

Focuses on _what_ the data does, not _how_ it does it.

Common Abstract Data Types:
- **[[List]]**: Collection of ordered elements with operations like insert, delete, and search.
- **[[Stack]]**: Collection with LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior.
- **[[Queue]]**: Collection with FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior.
- **[[Set (Abstract Data Type)|Set]]**: Collection of unique elements.
- **[[Map]]**: Collection of key-value pairs with lookup, insert, and delete operations.
