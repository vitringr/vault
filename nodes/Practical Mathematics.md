# Practical Mathematics

The nature of [[Mathematics]] astonishes.

Its beauty makes it easy to get lost in search of deeper meaning.

Hoever, there are times when one needs to be practical in order to solve a problem.

To be practical, one should use mathematics merely as a tool for [[Problem-solving]]. If it works - it works.

Be aware of the duality between the practice and the art.
