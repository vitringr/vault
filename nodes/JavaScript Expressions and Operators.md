# JavaScript Expressions and Operators

All about expressions and operators in JavaScript.

---

## Conditional Operators

**Ternary Operator**:
The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.
Syntax: `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`

## Comma Operator

Evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand.

Syntax: `expr1, expr2, expr3 // , ...`

## Unary Operators

Operation with only one operand.

- `delete`: Deletes a property from an object.
- `void`: Evaluates an expression and discards its return value.
- `typeof`: Determines the type of a given object.
- `+`: The _unary plus_ operator converts its operand to `Number` type.
- `-`: The _unary negation_ operator converts its operand to `Number` type and then negates it.
- `~`: Bitwise NOT operator.
- `!`: Logical NOT operator.
- `await`: Pause and resume an async function and wait for the promise's fulfillment/rejection.
