# Random Generation

The process of generating [[Random]] or [[Pseudorandom]] data.

---

The goal is the [[Procedural Generation]] of seemingly unpredictable data.

## Pseudorandom Number Generator

Involves using [[Determinism|Deterministic]] [[Algorithm|Algorithms]] that generate generate sequences of numbers, starting from an initial _seed_ value.

The generators scramble the initial value well enough that it appears unpredictable.

See [[Chaos Theory]]

## True Random Number Generator

Involves generating data using unpredictable physical phenomenons from the outside world.
