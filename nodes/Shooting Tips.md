# Shooting Tips

Discipline!

Always be safe: [[Firearm Safety]]

## Training

**Both eyes open at all times**: This prepares you for adrenaline. Focus on the crosshair having the target blurred. Switch focus to the target when needed. EDIT: I actually think looking at the target, having the iron-sight blurred may be better, especially when tactics are more important than the most precise aim possible. Having the best vision over your target seems better, especially at shorter distances. Also, some people shoot even from the hip and manage to hit targets, so tactics wise it should be sufficient enough.

## Control

**Don't grip too hard:** There is no need to squeeze that much.

**Smooth trigger pull**: The trigger should be pulled without investing the whole arm in the movement. Just the finger in order to prevent excessive movement of the arm.

**Don't telegraph the recoil:** Let it happen. Don't try to compensate for the recoil by pulling the gun just before the shot.

## Aim

**Don't fix mistakes with other mistakes**: Don't overcompensate for errors in shooting. Invest in negating the mistakes themselves.
