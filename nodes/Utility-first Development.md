# Utility-first Development

[[Software Development]] paradigm where you build utilities (debugging tools, helper systems) first, and only then implement core features.

---

Battle-tested approach to high-quality, maintainable software development.

## Motivation

Why Do It?

**The Problem**: Software development often involves roadblocks - some small, some catastrophic. When a project becomes large/complex enough, so do the issues. Without the right tools, development slows to a crawl.

**The Solution**: Build the tools first. They ensure smoother development, remain useful long-term, and can be reused.

**Time**: The time it takes to build a utility can often be less than the time it takes to build (and debug) something without the utility.

**Clarity**: Good tools preempt bugs by exposing hidden issues early. Many bugs stem from poor visibilityâ€”utilities fix that.
