# Command-line Interface

Text-based user interface used to interact with a [[Computer's]] [[Software]] and [[Operating System]].

---

Works by typing commands into a [[Computer Terminal]] running the CLI.

**Control**: Allows for direct access of system functions.

**Program**: CLI is made possible by command-line interpreters or processors, which are [[Computer Program|Computer Programs]] that interpret and execute commands.

**Resource Efficiency**: Generally much more efficient than a GUI, as the CLI does not rely on graphical rendering.

**Automation**: CLI enables easy automation as commands can be stored in a script file and used repeatedly.
