# Easing Function

Function controlling how the intermediate values are calculated during [[Interpolation]].

---

Controls the rate of change in transitions/animations.

Allows for more natural and visually appealing motion.

## Implementation

Interpolation functions, like [[Linear Interpolation]], use a _step_ (or _percent_) value.

The idea is to tweak that value before the interpolation.

See [[Easing Functions List]]
