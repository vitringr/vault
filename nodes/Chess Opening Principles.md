# Chess Opening Principles

General principles and guidelines for the opening phase of the game.

---

There are no absolutes.

**Develop your pieces**: It's really important to develop your position by getting your pieces out. In general, the minor pieces should come out first.

**Don't play the Queen too early**: The problem with playing the Queen early is that she can get stuck escaping danger and losing tempo. She is the most valuable piece so it's difficult to use her for exchanges.

**Don't move a piece twice early**: Moving a piece twice early probably means that the other pieces are not being developed.

**Castle early**: Castle before the tempo gets to you and you lose the chance to.

**Control the center**: The central squares (`d4`, `e4`, `d5`, `e5`) are generally the most important ones. Try to control them if possible.

**Connect the Rooks**: Rooks work better when connected as a [[Battery (Chess)|Battery]].

**Develop plans, not just pieces**: Rather than developing aimlessly, it's important to use tactics and strategy.
