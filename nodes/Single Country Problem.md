# Single Country Problem

Expanding a country indefinitely becomes unfeasible and counterproductive due to the [[Fragmentation Due to Expansion]] problem.

---

It is said that Genghis Khan sought to expand the Mongol Empire until it encompassed the entire world. However, even if he could have achieved this, it would not have been sustainable. As the empire expanded, it would naturally fragment. The Mongol Empire would have inevitably subdivided itself so many times that it would lose the cohesion and benefits of being a unified entity. The initial subdivisions would have become new countries, and further subdivisions would have created cities, regions, and so on. Ultimately, the empire would dissolve into smaller, independent units, until the concept of the empire as an entity is gone.
