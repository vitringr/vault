# Reward Beautiful Gameplay

Design gameplay that rewards players who try to play in a beautiful way.

## The Problem

There is often a difference between beautiful gameplay and competitive gameplay.

When players focus on winning, the game might not look as good.
When players focus on beautiful play, they might not win as much.

## The Solution

Design gameplay that rewards playing beautifully and reaching [[Flow State]].

Avoid scenarios where the player is forced to decide between beautiful and winning.

The goal is to reach perfect union between playing beautifully and playing to win.

## Examples

**[[ULTRAKILL]]**: Integrates style directly into the game as a gameplay system.

**[[DOOM]]**: Hidden designs that reward aggressive play and punish inactivity.

**[[Magicka]]**: Using the whole arsenal is the most effective way to play.
