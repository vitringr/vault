# Parabola

A U-shaped curve that represents the [[Graph (Plot)|Graph]] of a [[Quadratic Equation]]

---

For algebraic forms, see [[Quadratic Equation#algebraic-forms]]

**Vertex**: The minimum or maximum point of a parabola.

**Symmetry**: Parabolas are symmetric with respect to their axis of symmetry. Each y-coordinate that is not at the vertex occurs twice.

**Axis of Symmetry**: Vertical line that passes through the vertex of the parabola, dividing it into two mirror-image halves.

**Opening**:
If `a > 0` the parabola opens upward.
If `a < 0` the parabola opens downward.

**Width**:
A larger absolute value of `a` makes the parabola narrower.
A smaller absolute value of `a` makes the parabola wider.

**Shifting**: In the form `y = a(x - h)^2 + k`, the parabola shifts horizontally by `h` units and vertically by `k` units.
