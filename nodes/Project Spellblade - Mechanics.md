# Project Spellblade - Mechanics

The fundamental gameplay mechanics.

---

Roguelike influences such as Hades.

---

## Abilities

Either `9` or `12` abilities.

With `3` orbs and `2` permutations, there are `9` combinations. Can add additional `3` for single orb-attack combination, for a total of `12`.

```
QQ, QW, QE,
WQ, WW, WE,
EQ, EW, EE,

Qa, Wa, Ea
```

Currently thinking about `9`.

## Attack

Melee range attack.

**Spam**: Repeatable with no cooldown. The attack rate should be relatively fast, ever increasing.

- Being able to hold the button down in addition to spamming it is probably a good idea. Should be toggled from settings.

**Effect**: Attacks interact with the effects of spells.
