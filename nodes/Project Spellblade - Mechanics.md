# Project Spellblade - Mechanics

The fundamental gameplay mechanics.

---

Roguelike influences such as Hades.

---

## Abilities

Either `9` or `12` abilities.

With `3` orbs and `2` permutations, there are `9` combinations. Can add additional `3` for single orb-attack combination, for a total of `12`.

```
QQ, QW, QE,
WQ, WW, WE,
EQ, EW, EE,

Qa, Wa, Ea
```

Currently thinking about `9`.

### Unlocks

Generic abilities, each in one of the `9` slots.

Something like:

- `QQ`: Offense-Front
- `QW`: Offense-Bolt
- `QE`: Offense-AOE
- `WQ`: Enchant
- `WW`: Block
- `WE`: Aura
- `EQ`: Totem
- `EW`: Sense/Heal/Debuff (?)
- `EE`: Dash

With base default abilities at level 1.

Default ones can also be changed from talents, but still remain level 1.

Maybe talents can also affect the weight of randomness of some elements/abilities.

During gameplay, random unlocks for each ability, increasing it's level. Kinda Hades-like.

For example Offsense-Bolt level 1 by default, with Magic Bolt. Then in game, get the choice of level 2 Fireball or level 2 Chaos Bolt, or even level 3 Chaos Bolt.

That way, the same key combos apply to the same mechanics.

## Attack

Melee range attack.

**Spam**: Repeatable with no cooldown. The attack rate should be relatively fast, ever increasing.

- Being able to hold the button down in addition to spamming it is probably a good idea. Should be toggled from settings.

**Effect**: Attacks interact with the effects of spells.
