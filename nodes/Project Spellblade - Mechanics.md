# Project Spellblade - Mechanics

The fundamental gameplay mechanics.

---

Roguelike influences such as Hades.

## Attack

Melee range attack.

**Spam**: Repeatable with no cooldown. The attack rate should be relatively fast, ever increasing.

- Being able to hold the button down in addition to spamming it is probably a good idea. Should be toggled from settings.

**Effect**: Attacks interact with the effects of spells.
