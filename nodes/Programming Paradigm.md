# Programming Paradigm

Predefined [[Software Architecture]] principles that define the style, structure, [[Software Design|design]] and methodology of [[Software Development]].

---

Programming paradigms are predefined high-level guidelines and methodologies for [[Programming]].

## Paradigms

### [[Imperative Programming]]

Describes computation as a sequence of statements that change program state.

- **[[Procedural Programming]]**: Organizes code into procedures (functions/subroutines).

### [[Declarative Programming]]

Specifies _what_ should be computed rather than _how_, abstracting control flow.

- **[[Functional Programming]]**: Treats computation as evaluation of pure mathematical functions, avoiding mutable state.

### [[Object-Oriented Programming]]

Structures programs as collections of interacting objects, combining data and behavior.
