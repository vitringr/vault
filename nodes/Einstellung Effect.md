Tendency to rely on familiar solutions even when better and more appropriate ones are available.

The Einstellung effect can limit an individual's ability to solve problems by impeding innovation, creativity and learning.

Once a strategy has been successful, it becomes a preferred approach, creating a mental set that can be difficult to break.
