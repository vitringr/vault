King's Indian is an adaptive [[Hypermodernism (Chess)|Hypermodern]] opening.

- **White**: See [[King's Indian Attack]]
- **Black**: See [[King's Indian Defense]] or [[Pirc Defense]]

## Benefits

**Consistency**: The system can be played in almost any game, regardless of the opponent's opener. This is a huge benefit as it allows the player to bypass learning tons of theory.

**Mirror**: Since the same system can be used for both White and Black, this adds an additional level of consistency, since the player can re-use the same concepts, strategies, and tactics for both sides.

**Adaptive**: The system allows for both aggressive or quiet play. Different components can be shifted depending on the situation. The player can often choose the style that suits him.

## Strategy

**Structure**: The first major idea in the [[Opening (Chess Phase)|opening]] is to develop the King's Indian structure - kingside [[Fianchetto]], Knight on the `f` file, and castle.

### Center

**Retake**: Following [[Hypermodernism (Chess)|hypermodern]] principles, control the center indirectly while building the King's Indian structure, only to re-take it later.

**Lines**: There are different ways to approach this, but the main King's Indian line is pushing the `e` pawn.

The center, especially after pushing the `e` pawn, can either be opened or closed:

- **Open**: If the opponent takes the center pawn, you should usually be in a good position to recapture and play for center control. After a series of recaptures, the Bishop diagonal and the Rook file can be opened.
- **Closed**: If the opponent closes the center by a pawn lock, you can then choose to play for a kingside push, maneuvering your pieces to the kingside and opening it with a pawn storm.

### Plans

## Scenarios

**Avoiding Bishop Trade**: If there's an enemy Bishop with Queen support attacking your Fianchetto Bishop, and your Rook is already moved out of the way, you can just retreat your Bishop. Perserving the Fianchetto Bishop can be good idea.

**Double Kick**: The opponent may have his Knight and Bishop both on the `c` file. This is a common pattern. You can push your `c` pawn once, allowing your `b` pawn to kick both Bishop and Knight one by one. This may ruin his structure, while also developing your queenside pawns with tempo.

```

**Knight `a` and `c`**: The queenside Knight can be developed to the `c` file, either through `a` or `d`. The `a` pawn should be pushed forward to prevent the Knight from being kicked away.
