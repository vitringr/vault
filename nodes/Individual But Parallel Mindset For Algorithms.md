# Individual But Parallel Mindset For Algorithms

Many algorithms work on single things, but the actual value of the algorithm shines when applied to a collection of said things.

---

For example many [[Creative Coding]] and [[Computer Graphics]] algorithms work on single pixels in space, maybe changing a single number that represents the pixel's color. But the visual result of the algorithm is only visible when applied to many pixels at once.

Take [[Noise (Procedural Generation)]] algorithms for example. They take an input number, and with it produce an output number. Having a single number like that doesn't immediately show any interesting results. But having a field of such numbers and applying the algorithm to all of them produces an interesting pattern.

When creating and trying to understand such algorithms, I think that the proper mindset is focusing somewhere between an individual unit, and the whole collection of units.

If focused only on a single point, the algorithm might not make sense, as it lose the combined effect.

If focused on the whole collection at once, things can get overwhelming, losing sense of what a single point actually does.

Maybe focusing somewhere between the single and the many can lead to the most clarity.
