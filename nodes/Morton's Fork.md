# Morton's Fork

False dilemma variant in which contradictory observations lead to the same conclusion.

---

**Story**: John Morton was made archbishop. He rationalised requiring the payment of a benevolence (tax) to King Henry by reasoning that someone living modestly must be saving money, and therefore could afford the benevolence, whereas someone living extravagantly was obviously rich, and therefore could also afford the benevolence.
