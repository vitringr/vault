# Preventing Panic Attacks

Practical guidelines to prevent and intercept panic attacks.

---

**The panic attack is not a rational problem. It's mostly a physiological one.**

Do not attempt to intercept it in a rational manner. Instead, try to physiologically calm yourself down.

Aim to prevent the fight/flight/freeze state by overloading yourself with 'relaxing' stimulus.

- Deep breaths through the nose (7 seconds inhale : 11 seconds exhale rate).
- Physical activity.
- Sexual focus.
- Stimulate the neck sensors by massage, by turning the head left to right, or by emitting 'M-sound' vibrations.

If the trigger of the problem is an existential one and you want to tackle the problem rationally, do it _AFTER_ you calm yourself and reach a relaxed state. Otherwise it's extremely irrational. Fight on your own terms.
