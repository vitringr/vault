# Slope

Ratio of vertical change (rise) to horizontal change (run).

Measures the steepness and direction of a [[Line]].

`slope = change in y / change in x`

---

Typically represented as `m`.

Sometimes referred to as _rise over run_.

| Slope     | Relation  | Line       | Description                                    |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Positive  | `m > 0`   | Increasing | The line rises as it moves from left to right. |
| Negative  | `m < 0`   | Decreasing | The line falls as it moves from left to right. |
| Zero      | `m = 0`   | Horizontal | The line is horizontal.                        |
| Undefined | `m = NaN` | Vertical   | The line is vertical.                          |

Note: While the term _"infinite slope"_ is sometimes used informally, the slope of a vertical line is _undefined_. Since vertical lines have no horizontal change, that would involve division by zero, so the concept of slope does not apply.
