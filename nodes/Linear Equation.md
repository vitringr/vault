# Linear Equation

(First-Degree Polynomial)

The [[Equation]] of a first degree [[Polynomial]].

---

Describes a straight [[Line]] in a [[Coordinate System]].

## Algebraic Forms

**One variable form**: `ax + b = 0` with `a != 0`

**Multiple variables form**: `a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + ... + aₙxₙ + b = 0` with `ai != 0`

**Slope-Intercept Form**: `y = mx + b` where `m` is the [[Slope]] of the line, and `b` is the y-intercept.
