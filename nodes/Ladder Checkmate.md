# Ladder Checkmate

Common [[Checkmate Pattern]] where two major pieces work together to push the enemy King into the edge of the board.

---

```chesser
fen: R3k3/1R6/8/8/5K2/8/8/8 b - - 0 1
```

**Safety**: If the enemy King gets too close to a Rook while being pushed, the Rook can go to the other side of the board and continue.
