# Chinese Room

Thought experiment that challenges the [[Computational Theory of Mind]] on [[Qualia]].

---

_"A person who does not understand Chinese is isolated in a room with a book containing detailed instructions for manipulating Chinese symbols. When Chinese text is passed into the room, the person follows the book's instructions to produce Chinese symbols that, to fluent Chinese speakers outside the room, appear to be appropriate responses."_

**Note**: An important note is that the person is just following syntactic rules without semantic comprehension, and neither the human nor the room as a whole understands Chinese.

**AI Argument**: In the context of [[Artificial Intelligence]], the argument is that the program doesn't truly "understand" language, even though it successfully operates with it.
