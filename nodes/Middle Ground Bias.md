# Middle Ground Bias

Tendency to assume that the truth is always in the middle between two opposites.

Derives from the [[Middle Ground Fallacy]].

**Avoidance of Extremes**: People often have a natural aversion to extreme positions, associating them with conflict or irrationality. This aversion can bias them towards moderate positions.

**Desire for Consensus**: There is often a psychological comfort in achieving consensus. The middle ground can seem like a compromise that keeps both sides somewhat satisfied, leading to a bias towards moderation.

**Simplified Decision-Making**: It's easy to simplify a complex issue by deciding that the middle point is correct by default. This is a lazy way of reasoning.
