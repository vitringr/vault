# Rigid Transformation

[[Transformation]] that preserves the exact distance between every pair of points.

---

Geometric transformation that only changes the position and orientation of an object, without altering its shape or size.

All rigid transformations can be described as a combination of [[Rotation]] and translation.

- **Rotation**: Rotates an object around a point (in 2D), or around an axis (in 3D) by a given angle.
- **Translation**: Moves every point of the object by a constant factor.

## Properties

Rigid transformations are characterized by preserving all Euclidean geometric properties:

- **Distances**: Lengths between points remain unchanged.
- **Angles**: Angles between lines remain unchanged.
- **Parallelism**: Parallel lines remain parallel.
- **Area/Volume**: The size of the object is preserved.
- **Orientation**: The object is not mirrored.
