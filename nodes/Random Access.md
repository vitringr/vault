# Random Access

(Direct Access)

The ability to access an arbitrary element of a sequence directly, roughly as easily and efficiently as any other, no matter how many elements there may be.

---

This is a key feature in [[Data Structure|Data Structures]] like [[Array|Arrays]], where any element can be accessed by its index in constant time, `O(1)`.
