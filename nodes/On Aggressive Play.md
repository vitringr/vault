# On Aggressive Play

Epiphany about aggression in strategy.

---

Reflecting back, in every game that I played, I was usually very passive and defensive in the beginning. The default behavior is to defend myself, hoping that eventually the opponent would make a mistake. Basically survive until I'm able to abuse a mistake, or to overwhelm the opponent. That was the default pattern in every beginning. However, when I got better at those games, the behavior would change. The confidence grows, and the aggression kicks in. The play becomes offensive and proactive. The pressure increases. This has always given good overall results, even after a drastic change in playstyle. This concept of aggression, pressure, and proactivity, seems to be essential in strategy. It seems like the winning mindset is that of the hunter, not of the prey. The man told me that aggression and fear are the two faces of the same coin. Activating one deactivates the other. At this point I feel like uncontrolled fear is far worse than its counterpart. Apart from training it, one way to be more aggressive is to be more confident. One way to be more confident is to know that your defense is solid. In that sense, defense compliments offense, as it enables offense. Offense compliments defense, as it forces the defending player to continue defending himself instead of fighting back. Focusing on my own comfort, defending myself to avoiding being stuck in bad positions, I had overlooked another, equally important concept - the comfort of the opponent. Sometimes it is worth to reduce your own comfort a bit, in order to reduce the comfort of the opponent greatly.
