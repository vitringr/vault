# Ohm's Law

Fundamental principle in [[Electrical Engineering]] that describes the relationship between **Voltage**, **Current**, and **Resistance**.

**`V = I * R`**

**`I = V / R`**

**`R = V / I`**

---

- **`I`** is the **Current (A)** through the conductor.
- **`V`** is the **Voltage (V)** measured across the conductor.
- **`R`** is the **Resistance (Î©)** of the conductor.

**Scope**: Ohm's law is an empirical law, a generalization based on many experiments. While it accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of electrically conductive materials, there are some exceptions. The exceptions are called "non-ohmic" materials as they do not obey Ohm's law.
