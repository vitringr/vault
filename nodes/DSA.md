# DSA

(Data Structures and Algorithms)

Foundation in [[Computer Science]] and problem-solving.

---

Problems in computrer science and [[Software Engineering]] are solved using various [[Data Structure|Data Structures]] and [[Algorithm|Algorithms]].

Data structures focus on storing and organizing data, while algorithms focus on the operations that can be performed on the data.

**Efficiency**: Understanding [[Computational Complexity]] is important for efficient problem solving.

**General Approach**: In general, when faced with a computational problem, a good approach is to first think about an efficient data representation of the problem, and then think of efficient ways to operate on it.

**Reusable Patterns**: Learning DSA helps recognize reusable problem-solving patterns and when to apply them.
