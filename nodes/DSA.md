# DSA

(Data Structures and Algorithms)

Foundation in [[Computer Science]] and problem-solving.

---

Problems in computrer science and [[Software Engineering]] are solved using various data structures and algorithms.

Data structures focus on storing and organizing data, while algorithms focus on the operations that can be performed on the data.

In general, when faced with a computational problem, a good approach is to first think about the data representation of the problem, and then think of efficient ways to operate on it.

**Patterns**: Learning DSA helps recognize reusable problem-solving patterns and when to apply them.

**Efficiency**: Understanding [[Computational Complexity]] is important for efficient problem solving.
