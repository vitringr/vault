# Bundler

[[Software]] tool that combines multiple files into a smaller, more optimized whole. 

---

Resolves dependencies, processes code, and prepares assets for production.

**Performance**: Bundlers [[Minification (Software Engineering)|minify]] code, [[Dead Code Elimination|remove dead code]], and optimize assets.

**Dependency Management**: Resolves imports/exports and makes sure everything is loaded in the correct order.

**Compatibility**: Bundlers can transpile wrapped code into older, more stable/compatible versions.
