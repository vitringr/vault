# Gambler's Fallacy

Incorrect assumption that if an event (whose occurrences are independent from eachother) has occurred less frequently than expected, it is more likely to happen again in the future, or vice versa.

---

Both a logical fallacy and a cognitive bias.

## Coin Toss

**Question**: _"After 20 coins have landed on heads, what's the probability of the 21st coin landing on heads as well?"_

**Fallacy (Mistake)**: The probability of landing a 21st consecutive head is low.

**Answer (Correct)**: The probability of the 21st coin landing on heads remains `50%`, independent of previous tosses.

The outcomes in different tosses are statistically independent, and yet people tend to incorrectly assume that the probability is related to the history of tosses.
