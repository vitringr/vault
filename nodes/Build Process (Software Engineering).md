# Build Process (Software Engineering)

The process of converting development [[Source Code]] into a standalone software product.

---

**Compilation**: See [[Compiler]]

**Linking**: Combines code with libraries and dependencies to create a complete executable or binary.

**Packaging**: The compiled and linked code is packaged into a distributable format. Examples: `.exe`, `.jar`, `.zip`, `.msi`, `.deb`, [[Container Image]], etc.

**Resource Inclusion**: Non-code resources like configuration, images, and data files are bundled into the whole.

**Versioning**: Manages version numbers and identifiers to the build to track changes and releases.

**Testing**: Automated tests are often run as part of the build process to ensure the software works as expected.

**Deployment**: The build artifact is deployed to a target environment, such as a [[Server]].
