# Opposition (Chess)

Situation where two Kings face each other on a file/rank with only one square between them.

---

Since the Kings cannot move any closer to each other, each King prevents the other's advance, creating a mutual blockade.

In this situation, the player not having to move is said to _have the opposition_.

**Direct Opposition**: Direct opposition is when the Kigns are on the same rank or file and are separated by one square. The term 'opposition' normally refers to direct opposition.

**Distant Opposition**: Distant opposition is when the Kings are separated by more than one square on the same rank or file. Same rules apply with an **odd** number of squares between them.
