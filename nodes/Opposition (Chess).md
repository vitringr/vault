# Opposition (Chess)

Situation where two Kings block each other on the same file or rank.

```

Since the Kings cannot move any closer to each other, each King prevents the other's advance, creating a mutual blockade.

In this situation, the player not having to move is said to _have the opposition_.

The player that has the opposition can force the other player out of important squares by [[Zugzwang]].

**Application**: Opposition is a fundamental concept for the [[Endgame (Chess Phase)|Endgame]], where it can be applied to win a game, or force a [[Draw (Chess)|draw]].

## Types

**Direct Opposition**: When the Kigns are on the same rank or file and are separated by one square. The term 'opposition' normally refers to direct opposition.

**Distant Opposition**: When the Kings are separated by more than one square on the same rank or file. Same rules apply with an **odd** number of squares between them.

**Diagonal Opposition**: When the Kings are aligned diagonally with one square between them.

## File Walk

Suppose that the Kings are in direct opposition on the same file. White wants to continue forward; Black wants to block him.

Whoever has the opposition will accomplish his goal.

**White Moves**: Black has the opposition, White has to move. Since White cannot move forward, he will need to go sideways, perpendicular to the desired file. For every sideways move, Black will answer in return and take the opposition again. If White steps back, Black can follow, or choose to take distant opposition. Either way there is no forward progress for White.

**Black Moves**: White has the opposition, Black has to move. Black can either go back, diagonally back, or sideways. For every back or diagonal back step, White can follow. If Black moves to the side, White can penetrate diagonally.
