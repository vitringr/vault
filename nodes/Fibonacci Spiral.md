# Fibonacci Spiral

Geometric shape formed by connecting quarter-circle arcs, whose radii are based on the [[Fibonacci Sequence]].

---

This spiral is an approximation of the [[Golden Spiral]].

The Fibonacci spiral can be seen in nature and is often (rightly) associated with aesthetically pleasing proportions.

## Construction

**Fibonacci Sequence**: Start with a grid of squares whose side lengths correspond to the Fibonacci sequence (`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...`).

**Arrangement**: Place the squares adjacent to one another in a spiraling pattern.

**Spiral**: In each square, draw a quarter-circle arc connecting the two opposite corners of the square.
