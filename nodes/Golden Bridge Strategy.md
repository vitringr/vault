# Golden Bridge Strategy

Intentionally giving an opponent a way of retreat.

---

**Avoiding Conflict**: Leaving the opponent with a possibility of retreat can avoid conflict.

**Cornered Opponent**: It can be unwise to pressure a cornered opponent, since they will be forced to fight to the death. Desperation can inspire courage.

It's better to chase down a fleeting opponent rather than fighting a desperate one.
