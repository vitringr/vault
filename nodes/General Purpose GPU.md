# General Purpose GPU

The use of a [[GPU|Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)|]] for arbitrary data processing and [[Computation]].

---

Useful for computations beyond traditional graphics rendering, such as simulations, [[Machine Learning]], and data processing.

**Parallel Processing**: The GPU has a large quantity of smaller cores optimized for parallel tasks.

**Hardware Optimization**: GPGPU leverages the advantages of GPU [[Hardware]], which is build with various performance optimizations in mind.
