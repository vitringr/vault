# Cartesian Coordinate System

Coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a space by a set of numerical coordinates.

---

**Origin**: The reference point where all the axes intersect. All measurements are made relative to this point. Has zero as coordinates on all dimensions.

**Axes**: Set of oriented reference lines. A single axis is essentially a [[Number Line]], extending infinitely in both directions. The axes are generally perpendicular to each other, although not a requirement.

**Coordinates**: Ordered tuple `(x, y, z... n)` that represents the signed displacements from the origin along each axis. Coordinates establish a [[Bijection]] between points in space and numerical addresses.

## Mathematical Foundation

**Vector Space**: The Cartesian system provides a natural framework for a [[Vector Space]].

Any point can be represented by a position [[Vector]] from the origin.

**Basis Vectors**: The Cartesian system is described by a set of [[Basis Vectors]]. In the standard system, these are unit vectors along each axis.

Any vector can be expressed as a linear combination (scaling and summation) of these basis vectors.
