# Cartesian Coordinate System

Coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates.

---

**Coordinates**: The coordinates represent the distances to the point from fixed perpendicular directed lines.

**Axes**: The coordinate lines. The axes are generally _x_ (horizontal) and _y_ (vertical).

- The system can be extended to multiple dimensions. For 3D coordinates, a _z_ axis is added as depth.

**Origin**: The point where all the axes meet. Has `[0, 0]` as coordinates.
