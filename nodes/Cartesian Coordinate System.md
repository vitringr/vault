# Cartesian Coordinate System

Coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates.

---

**Axes**: The coordinate lines. The axes are generally _x_ (horizontal) and _y_ (vertical).

- A single axis is essentially a [[Number Line]]. It extends infinitely in either direction.
- The system can be extended to multiple dimensions. For 3D coordinates, a _z_ axis is added as depth.
- The axes are generally perpendicular to each other, although this is arbitrary.

**Origin**: The point where all the axes meet. Has `[0, 0]` as coordinates.

**Coordinates**: The coordinates represent the distances from the origin to the point.

**Direction Notation**: In general, the standard cardinal directions are used: _North (`y+`, Top)_, _East (`x+`, Right)_, _South (`y-`, Bottom)_, and _West (`x-`, Left)_.

- Some systems might change this. For example, it is common for systems to reverse the `y` direction.
