# Scope (Computer Science)

The _scope_ of a [[Name Binding]] is the part of a [[Computer Program]] where the name binding is valid.

---

In other parts (scopes) of the program, the same name may refer to a different entity, or nothing at all.

**Preventing Name Collisions**: Scope helps prevent name collisions by allowing the same name to refer to different entities as long as the names have separate scopes.
