# Conway's Game of Life

[[Cellular Automaton|Cellular Automata]] that produces interesting behavior with simple rules.

---

Each cell has only two states - `dead` or `alive`.

Living cells survive if they have `2` or `3` living neighbors. Living cells die if they have fewer than `2` or more than `3` living neighbors. Dead cells come to life if they have exactly `3` living neighbors.

**Autonomy**: Does not require player input after setup.
