# Free and Open Source

[[Software Licensing]] where [[Source Code]] is free and publicly available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

---

The four essential freedoms:

1. Use for any purpose
2. Study and modify
3. Redistribute copies
4. Distribute modified versions

**Freedom Preservation**: Some FOSS licenses can enforce copyleft, meaning that the software and its derivatives should always remain free.
