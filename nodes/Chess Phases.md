# Chess Phases

The three phases of a chess game: [[Opening (Chess Phase)|Opening]], [[Middlegame (Chess Phase)|Middlegame]], [[Endgame (Chess Phase)|Endgame]].

---

While somewhat abstract and arbitrary, the three phases can be defined as:

1. **Opening**: The initial stage of the game.
2. **Middlegame**: After each player has developed their pieces and brought their king to relative safety.
3. **Endgame**: The final stage of the game. Begins when few pieces are left on the board.
