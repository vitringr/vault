# King and Pawn vs King

The system to win King and Pawn vs King in the endgame.

---

The idea is to use the King to escort the Pawn promotion, winning by a [[King and Queen Checkmate]] afterwards.

**Opposition**: See [[Opposition (Chess)]]

**Key Squares**: Refers to the 3 perpendicular squares that are one square infront of your Pawn.

The strategy is to have your King on the _key squares_, causing _opposition_ with the enemy King. Whenever the enemy King breaks the opposition, go to the side and create a safe path for the Pawn.

## A/H File Pawn

If the Pawn is on the A or H file, the concept changes.

**No Space Gain**: The problem with the A or H file is that the King wouldn't be able to gain space after being in opposition, since one of the sides is blocked as it's the end of the board.

**Promotion Square King**: The goal of the lone King is to occupy the Pawn's promotion square. Then the game is a draw.

Having a Bishop (the same color as the promotion square) or a Knight can prevent the draw by checking the King on the promotion square, forcing him to move.
