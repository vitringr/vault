# King and Pawn vs King

The system to win King and Pawn vs King in the endgame.

---

The idea is to use the King to escort the Pawn promotion, winning by a [[King and Queen Checkmate]] afterwards.

**Opposition**: When the Kings are closest to eachother with only 1 square inbetween. Opposition can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

**Key Squares**: Refers to the 3 perpendicular squares that are one square infront of your Pawn.

The strategy is to have your King on the _key squares_, causing _opposition_ with the enemy King. Whenever the enemy King breaks the opposition, go to the side and create a safe path for the Pawn.
