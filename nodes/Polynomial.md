# Polynomial

[[Expression (Mathematics)]] that consists of [[Variable (Mathematics)|variables]] and coefficients.

---

Typically written as a sum of terms.

## Terms

Each term in a polynomial is a product of a coefficient and a variable raised to a non-negative integer exponent.

Polynomials have a finite number of terms.

Example: in `3x² - 2x + 1`, the terms are `3x²`, `-2x`, and `1`.

## Degree

The degree of a polynomial is the highest exponent of its variable.

Example: in `4x³ + 3x² + x + 7`, the degree is `3`.

**Degree one**: [[Linear Equation]]
**Degree two**: [[Quadratic Equation]]

## Standard Form

A polynomial is in standard form when its terms are written in descending order of their exponents.

Example: `2x³ - x² + 4x - 7` is in standard form.
