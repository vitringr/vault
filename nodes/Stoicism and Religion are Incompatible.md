# Stoicism and Religion are Incompatible

The truth-embracing nature of [[Stoicism]] is in direct conflict with religious conviction.

> The strength of a person's spirit is measured by how much truth he could tolerate, or more precisely, to what extent he needs to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened, muted, falsified.
> \- Friedrich Nietzsche

## Stoicism

Stoicism is a philosophy rooted in wisdom, rationality, self-control, and the acceptance of reality as it is.

Central to stoicism is the idea that we should align our will with the natural order of the universe, facing reality without delusion, which often involves accepting possibly uncomfortable truths about life, such as the inevitability of death, the impermancence of all things, and the limits of human control.

Stoicism encourages _embracing the undiluted truth_, no matter how painful.

## Religion

Religion is a belief system based on conviction.

Religious beliefs offer "explanations" and reassurances that can soften the blow of harsh truths. For example, the belief in a benevolent deity or an afterlife that provides comfort in the face of inevitable death, suffering, or injustice. While these beliefs may be helpful as illusory mechanisms that help cope with anxiety and despair, they involve blindly accepting certain premises without evidence.

## Completeness

Stoicism and religion share a common trait: they both function as all-or-nothing systems.

Stoicism demands complete acceptance of reality as it is, without selectively choosing which truths to acknowledge and which to ignore. There are no "half-truths". One must embrace everything in its entirety.

Similarly, religion requires absolute conviction and faith, leaving no space for selective belief. Faith is typically all-encompassing. One cannot fully embrace certain aspects while disregarding others.

In this way, both Stoicism and religion operate as systems that demand total commitment.

## Incompatibility

Two differing systems that both require full completeness in order to function cannot be compatible.

It's either one or the other. A zero-sum game.

Attempting to combine them results in neither being fully realized.

## Contrast

When chosing one or the other, consider the most highly contrasting factors.

**Truth**: In Stoicism, the truth is paramount. To accept and embrace the truth, one must first seek it, fostering curiosity, science, and wisdom. In religion, certain premises are often considered unquestionable, which stands in opposition to curiosity and the scientific method.

**Comfort**: While Stoicism does not directly offer comfort, it fosters alignment with nature and the development of resilience and courage. Religion, by contrast, provides comfort through reassuring beliefs, which creates a dependence on illusions and encourages avoidance of reality.

## Opinion

It's challenging to become a Stoic, but striving for it is far more virtuous than adopting a shallow religion and being a piece of shit coward.
