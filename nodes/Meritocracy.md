# Meritocracy

[[Political Philosophy]] and social system in which power, wealth, and opportunities are distributed based on individual ability, talent, and effort.

---

Encourages productivity, development, and innovation.

**Equal Opportunity**: All individuals should have the same chance to develop and demonstrate merit.

**Competition**: The competitive nature of this system could motivate and develop those who compete.

**Reward for Achievement**: Success can be earned through hard work and skill.

## Hybrid Model Opinion

I love the overall idea of meritocracy.

However, I don't think it's a complete system that can work on its own.

- Hyper-competition may harm well-being.
- Talent is a factor which, while being natural, does not provide equal opportunity.
- Can justify negative elitism. The "deserving rich" vs "undeserving poor".

Meritocracy should probably be combined with another form of government to balance out those negatives.
