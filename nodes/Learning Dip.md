# Learning Dip

Decline in motivation & progress when acquiring new skills.

---

Phase in the learning process where initial enthusiasm fades and challenges feel overwhelming.

**Beginner Curve**: The initial learning dip aligns with the fact that beginners often learn the most. This is because, for many skills, the learning curve starts steep and gradually flattens. At the beginning, you absorb large amounts of new information, while later stages focus on refining small details rather than grasping major concepts - which some may find less exciting or more challenging.

One should be aware that, in general, the learning rate in the beginning is not the same as the learning rate afterwards.

**Overcoming the Dip**: The problem is best resolved through persistence, will, and discipline. Apart from that, being aware of the existance of "the dip" as a concept also helps by knowing it is normal.

**Momentum**: The dip is often the worst phase in many disciplines. One can build momentum after overcoming the dip, as it's usually a gradual & constant increase afterwards.
