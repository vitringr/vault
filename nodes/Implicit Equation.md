# Implicit Equation

Relation of the form `R(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ) = 0`, where `R` is a [[Function (Mathematics)|Function]] of several variables.

In the context of [[Geometry]], an implicit equation can define a geometric object by stating a condition that its points must satisfy.

Defines a shape as the set of all points `(x, y)` (in 2D) or `(x, y, z)` (in 3D) that satisfy an equation.

Examples:

- Line: `ax + by + c = 0`
- Circle: `x² + y² - r² = 0`
- Sphere: `x² + y² + z² - r² = 0`

**Membership Test**: It's easy to check if a point lies on the shape by plugging it into the equation and seeing if it satisfies it.

**No "Primary" Variable**: All variables are treated equally. There is no sense of an input or an output.
