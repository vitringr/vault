Imagine every [[Vector]] as a scaling of the [[Basis Vectors]] `i` and `j`.
- Vector `i` equals `<1, 0>`.
- Vector `j` equals `<0, 1>`.

The scale of `i` determines the horizontal direction, and the scale of `j` determines the vertical direction.

- The origin is at `0i + 0j`.
- The vector `<1, 1>` is at `1i + 1j`.
- The vector `<3, 0>` is at `3i + 0j`.

Any vector `<x, y>` can be described as `xi + yj`.
