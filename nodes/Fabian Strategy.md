# Fabian Strategy

Using [[Attrition Strategy]] while avoiding or delaying direct engagements.

> The strategy of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, known as "Fabian strategy," was employed during the Second Punic War to counter the Carthaginian general Hannibal's invasion of Italy. After Hannibal's decisive victories at Trebia (218 BC) and Lake Trasimene (217 BC), Rome appointed Fabius as dictator. Instead of engaging Hannibal in direct battle, Fabius employed a war of attrition, focusing on small skirmishes and cutting off the Carthaginians' access to resources by targeting their foraging parties and implementing scorched-earth tactics.

> Hannibal, though a brilliant strategist, faced two major weaknesses: he was cut off from consistent supplies from Carthage, and his army, composed of Spanish mercenaries and Gaulish allies, lacked the patience and loyalty for long campaigns. Fabius capitalized on these weaknesses by avoiding large-scale engagements, wearing down the invaders over time. His strategy weakened Hannibal's forces and prevented the Carthaginians from mounting a successful siege on Rome, a walled city. Ultimately, Fabius aimed to starve and demoralize Hannibal's army, setting the stage for Rome to deliver a final, decisive blow when the Carthaginians were sufficiently weakened.
