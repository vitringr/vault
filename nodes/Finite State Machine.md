# Finite State Machine

[[Sequential Model of Computation]] and [[Abstract Machine]] that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.

**Transition**: The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs. This change is called a _transition_ between states.

The FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition.
