# The Scorpion and the Frog

Once upon a time, a scorpion wanted to cross a river. As he couldn't swim, he searched for a way to get across. Soon, he spotted a frog sitting by the riverbank.

The scorpion approached the frog and asked, _"Could you please carry me across the river on your back?"_

The frog was wary and replied, _"How do I know you won't sting me while we're crossing the river?"_

The scorpion promised, _"If I sting you, we'll both drown. It wouldn't make sense for me to do that."_

The frog thought about it and agreed. He allowed the scorpion to climb onto his back, and they began their journey across the river.

Midway through the crossing, the scorpion suddenly stung the frog.

As soon as the poison took effect and they both began to sink, the frog asked with his last breath, _"Why did you sting me? Now we will both drown."_

The scorpion simply replied, _"I couldn't help it. It's my nature."_
