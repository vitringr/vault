# Exchange When Ahead

When ahead in [[Piece Value|material]], it's generally good to exchange evenly.

---

**Endgame Advantage**: Material advantages get proportionally more significant with each piece that is taken off from the board.

- The difference between `11` and `12` is slight, but the difference between `1` and `2` is decisive.

**Simplicity**: If you have a winning position, reducing the complexity can be advantageous, as it can lower the chance to make mistake due to complexity.
