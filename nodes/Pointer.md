# Pointer

Entity that stores a memory address.

Generally in a [[Programming Language]] a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

The pointer is said to _reference_ a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored in that location is known as _dereferencing_ the pointer.
