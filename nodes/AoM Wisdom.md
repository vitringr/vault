# AoM Wisdom

## Mindset

**Always Think**: Always think about the game, the state of it, your opponent, your win condition.

**Play Calm**: Relax. Play calm. Don't let emotions influence your decisions.

**Never Surrender**: Learn to play from behind until you can't play anymore.

## Strategy

**Pressure**: Always pressure the opponent. Attack, attack, attack!

**Patience**: Don't take losing fights. If time is on your side wait until the last moment.

**Water Maps**: Either play dock vs dock, or scout to see if there are docks early and try to deny them with army. Whoever controls the water usually wins.

**Gold Deny**: Gold seems like the most important resource in the late game. Deny the gold of the opponent. Other resources cannot be denied.

**Resource Patrol**: Use patrolling units on enemy resources.

## Macro

**Walls**: Walls are cheap and should be used a lot.

**Building Placement**: Always try to place buildings strategically.

**Dwarf Switch**: You can switch to dwarf production instead of villagers when you want to save food.

**Age Up**: Don't forget to age up whenever you are in a safe state.

## Army

**Composition**: Always think about composition. Win the rock-paper-scissors.
