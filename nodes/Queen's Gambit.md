**Gambit**: White offers the `c4` pawn for free, with the idea that if Black takes it, White will dominate the center, and also easily recapture.

**Accept**: Black can accept the offer, leading into [[Queen's Gambit Accepted]].

**Decline**: Black can choose to support the `c5` pawn, leading into [[Queen's Gambit Declined]].
