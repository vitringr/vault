# Iterative Game Development and Design

Applying [[Iterative Development]] to [[Game Development]] and [[Game Design]].

---

Game design is feel-based. There is no single formula that accurately describes game feel and what makes a game fun. Therefore, games design is naturally dependant on [[Prototyping]] and testing until it "feels right". This makes game development and design a good case for the application of iterative development principles.
