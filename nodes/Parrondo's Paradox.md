# Parrondo's Paradox

Combination of multiple losing strategies becoming a winning strategy.

---

Consider two games **Game A** and **Game B** with the following rules:

**Game A**: You lose `$1` every time you play.

**Game B**: You count how much money you have. If it's an even number you win `$3`, otherwise you lose `$5`.

Begin with `$100`.

If you start playing **Game A** exclusively, you will lose all your money.
Similarly, if you start playing **Game B** exclusively, you will also lose all your money.

However, if you play the games alternatively, starting with **Game B**, followed by **Game A**, then **B**, and so on (**BABABA**...), you will win money.
