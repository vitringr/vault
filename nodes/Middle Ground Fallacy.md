# Middle Ground Fallacy

(Argument to Moderation)

Logical fallacy asuuming that the truth is always in the middle between two opposites.

---

The fallacy occurs when one argues that the middle point between two extremes must be correct simply because it is moderate, without considering whether one of the extremes might actually be correct or closer to the truth.

Does not necessarily suggest that an argument in the middle is false.

Leads to [[Middle Ground Bias]].

## Example

**Argument (True)**: _"The color of the sky is blue."_
**Argument (False)**: _"The color of the sky is yellow."_
**Moderation (False)**: _"The color of the sky is the intermediate color green."_

**Argument (True)**: _"Person A is entirely responsible."_
**Argument (False)**: _"Person B is entirely responsible."_
**Moderation (False)**: _"Therefore, both of them must be equaly responsible."_
