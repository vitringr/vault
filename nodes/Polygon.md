# Polygon

Plane figure made up of line segments connected to form a closed chain.

---

Closed two-dimensional shape formed by a finite chain of three or more straight line segments.

**Edge**: The line segments are called _edges_.

**Vertex**: The points where line segments meet are called _vertices_.

## Classification

Polygons are primarily classified by the number of sides.

| Sides | Name          |
| ----- | ------------- |
| `3`   | Triangle      |
| `4`   | Quadrilateral |
| `5`   | Pentagon      |
| `6`   | Hexagon       |
| `7`   | Heptagon      |
| `8`   | Octagon       |
| `9`   | Nonagon       |
| `10`  | Decagon       |
| `12`  | Dodecagon     |
| `n`   | _n_-gon       |

### Equality and Symmetry

**Equilateral**: All edges are of equal length.

**Equiangular**: All corner angles are equal.

**Regular**: Both equiangular and equiangular.

**Cyclic**: All corners lie on the same circumcircle.

**Tangential**: All sides are tangent to an inscribed circle.
