# Research Other Marketers

Learn from other marketers out there.

A lot of ideas are outdated. Find out modern ideas.

## Analyze

When you find a successful and modern marketer, try to figure out what he does and why it works.
Go to their website, google them, see where they are, what they post, who they interact with, etc.

Failing marketers may also be valuable. Research them as well.
Figure out what made their marketing fail, and try to learn from their mistakes.
