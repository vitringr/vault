# Quadratic Equation

(Second-Degree Polynomial)

Equation that describes a [[Parabola]] in a [[Coordinate System]].

Represents the equation of a [[Polynomial]] of the [[Polynomial#degree|second degree]].

## Algebraic Forms

**Standard Form**: `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` with `a != 0`
The most common form, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. Useful for applying the quadratic formula, factoring, or completing the square.

**Vertex Form**: `y = a(x - h)^2 + k`
Highlights the vertex `(h, k)` of the parabola. Useful for easily indentifying the vertex and understanding the direction and width of the parabola.

**Factored Form**: `y = a(x - r1)(x - r2)`
Expresses the quadratic as a product of its factors, where `r1` and `r2` are the roots. Useful for finding the roots directly and for [[Graph (Plot)|Graphing]] when the x-intercepts are known.
