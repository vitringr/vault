# Reciprocal Multiplication

Division can always be replaced by multiplication using the [[Multiplicative Inverse|Reciprocal (Multiplicative Inverse)]] of the divisor.

This can be useful for low level [[Programming]] as it's more efficient for some machines to compute multiplication instead of division.

For example, instead of dividing by `5`, you can multiply by `1/5 = 0.2`.
