# Outpost (Chess)

Highly advantageous square on the board.

---

Outposts are a fundamental concept in positional chess.

## Characteristics

Key characteristics that make a good outpost:

**Pawn Support**: Usually protected by pawns.

**Safe and Secure**: The square is not easily attacked.

**Influential Position**: Generally a central and/or advanced position.

## Importance

While there is the concept of [[Piece Value|piece value]], there's also the subtle concept of positional value. A good outpost can be the focal point of a position.

**Knight Outposts**: Knights are particularly effective on outposts as they can control many squares and are difficult to challenge.

## Creation

Good players need to be able to create outposts.

**Advance Pawns**: Push pawns to take control of key squares and create outposts for the pieces.

**Exploit Weaknesses**: Search for squares that are uncontrolled and aim to occupy them.

**Passed Pawns**: Passed pawns usually create good outposts, as the piece occupying the outpost wouldn't be threatened by enemy pawns.
