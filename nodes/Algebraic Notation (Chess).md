# Algebraic Notation (Chess)

The standard [[Chess Notation]].

---

Pieces represented by a letter:

| Piece  | Letter |
| ------ | ------ |
| King   | `K`    |
| Queen  | `Q`    |
| Rook   | `R`    |
| Bishop | `B`    |
| Knight | `N`    |

Pawns are not denoted by letters; only the destination square is written.

**Moves**: A move is written as the piece's letter (if not a pawn) followed by the destination square.

**Captures**: Captures are indicated by an `x` between the piece and the destination square.

**Castling**: Castling kingside is written as `O-O`. Castling queenside is written as `O-O-O`.

**Check**: A `+` sign is added if the move puts the opponent's King in check.

**Checkmate**: A `#` sign is used for checkmate.

**Promotion**: When a pawn promotes, the promoted piece is indicated after the move, for example `e8=Q`.

**Ambiguity**: If two pieces can move to the same square, the file or rank of the moving piece is added to clarify.

## Move Quality

**Bad Move**: The `?` after a move indicates a mistake or a weak move.

**Blunder**: The `??` after a move indicates a blunder.

**Good Move**: The `!` after a move indicates a good and strong move.

**Brilliant**: The `!!` after a move indicates a brilliant move.
