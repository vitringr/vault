# Graph (Plot)

The graphical representation of a mathematical relationship.

---

Visualizes the relationship between variables, showing how one variable changes with respect to another.

Represented as `(x, y)` coordinates on a [[Cartesian Coordinate System]].

**Relation Graph**: Represents all points `(x, y)` that satisfy a given relation.

**Equation Graph**: Represents all points `(x, y)` that satisfy a specific [[Equation]].

**Function Graph**: Represents a [[Function (Mathematics)|Function]] `y = f(x)`, where each input `x` corresponds to exactly one output `y`. See [[Vertical Line Test]].

**Continuity**: Whether the graph is unbroken and smooth. See [[Continuous Function]].

**Intercepts**: Points where the graph crosses the axes. At the x-intercept, `y = 0`. At the y-intercept, `x = 0`.

**Extrema**: Points where the graph reaches its highest or lowest values, either globally (absolute extrema) or locally (local extrema).

**Bounded Variables**: Variables are considered bounded if the graph is confined within certain limits, such as maximum and minimum values.
