# The Expensive Donkey

Traders were selling donkeys. Some donkeys cost 400, others 450, and some 500. One man, however, was selling his donkey for 2000.

Due to the high cost, his donkey sparked a lot of interest and gathered a crowd. Everyone was trying to figure out why the donkey cost so much more than the others.

"Is it much stronger than the others?" one person asked.
"No, not really," the trader replied.

"Is it very smart or something?" another person asked.
"Nope, it doesn't seem particularly smart," said the trader.

"Are there any special tricks that the donkey can do?"
"Not to my knowledge," answered the trader.

"Then why are you selling it for 2000?"

"Because I really need 2000 right now."
