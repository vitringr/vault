# Heuristic

Problem-solving approach or method that is not guaranteed to be perfect/optimal, but is sufficient enough for reaching an approximate solution.

---

Can sacrifice: _Perfection, Completeness, Optimality, Accuracy, Precision_ in order to gain _Solution, Speed_.

Sometimes heuristics are necessary, as 'complete' methods may fail to provide any exact solution in a search space, or in reasonable time.
