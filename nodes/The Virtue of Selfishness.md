## The Objectivist Ethics

The importance of actually understanding ethics, morality, and values.

Illustrates how those concepts are taken for granted, universally misunderstood, based on whims, left unquestioned and unanswered.

Only a living thing can have a concept of "value", as only living things have something to lose - life itself. Therefore an organism's life is its standard of value: that which furthers its life is the good, and that which threatens it is the evil.

**Consciousness as a means of survival.**: While simpler organisms such as plants can survive by means of automatic physical functions, higher organisms such as animals cannot. Their needs are more complex and the range of their actions is wider. A plant can obtain its food from the soil in which it grows. An animal has to hunt for it. Man has to produce it.

**Potential and Material**: Nothing is given to man on earth except a potential and the material on which to actualize it. The potential is a superlative machine: his consciousness; but it is a machine without a spark plug, a machine of which his own will has to be the spark plug, the self-starter and the driver; he has to discover how to use it and he has to keep it in constant action. The material is the whole of the universe, with no limits set to the knowledge he can acquire and to the enjoyment of life he can achieve. But everything he needs or desires has to be learned, discovered and produced by him-by his own choice, by his own effort, by his own mind.

Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction.

**Purpose of Ethics**: Ethics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man's survival by the nature of life.

Ethics are the abstract principles that a man can follow to guide his consciousness, and thus, his survival.

Survival is made possible by men who use reason. The parasitic survival of men who do not use reason is made possible only because of the first group.
