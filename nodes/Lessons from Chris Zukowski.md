## DEMOS

_The guy is big on creating demos._

## Steam Page Up Early

> Nice and early.

## Itch vs Steam

Use Itch for experimenting and marketing.

Use Steam to actually make money.

## Experiment on Social Media

Try out platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, etc.

If the game is immediately visually impressive, try to see if it blows up on social media.

> Dark and grimy games do better on Reddit.

If the game is not immediately visually impressive, go for a demo.

## Translate Your Steam Page

Translate Chinese, Korean, and Japanese first.

Translated pages will get localized to Popular Upcoming and New & Trending pages.

## Master a Genre

Be a master of the genre you're interested in.

Play a lot of demos or games of that genre.

> Stick to a genre (that Steam likes).

Sticking to the same genre allows code reuse and a snowball following effect.

## Following is Not Required

> Following is not required. It is not necessary. You're paying Steam to do that for you.
