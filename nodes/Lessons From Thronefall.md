# Lessons From Thronefall

Lessons learned from watching the Thronefall development videos.

---

## Prototype Hard

They had no idea what the game was going to be.

They created a ton of prototypes and game ideas.

They were realistic in their goals and expectations.

The "final" prototype was of a deck-building card game.

But in the end it wasn't even that.

_**"Fail Fast"**_

Prototype quickly, test things, be very realistic and critical of the results, don't be afraid to scrap and start another prototype.

Even scrapped prototypes can be useful. Some ideas remain between scraps.

Keep what feels good, discard what doesn't.

Go for **minimalism**. Details will always emerge afterwards.

## One Thing

Doing one thing, and doing it good.

Communicate to the potential players what the one thing is they can expect from the game.

## Assets

Experiment with AI art and AI styles generation.

Try `Geometrize`

Generate with AI ⇒ Edit with Photoshop ⇒ Style with AI

_**"Be cheap so you can be generous."**_

"Content should be easy to make, so you can make a lot of content."

A lot of assets were from the asset store.

## Organization

Every step of the way, from planning to design to implementation was well documented.

Every task is organized into the board and it has priority levels.

Assets and prototypes are documented and saved.

Feedback from players is also recorded.

## Design

Minimalist game design.

Remove frustrations from the player. For example automatically respawn and repair buildings, and don't add unecessary mechanics.
