# Chaos Theory

Studies the behavior of dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.

---

Small changes in the initial state of a system can lead to vastly different outcomes.

Chaos theory explores complex systems whose behavior appears random or unpredictable, even though they are governed by deterministic laws.

> Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.
