# Square Rule (Chess)

VIsualization technique to quickly assess if a Pawn can promote before the King reaches it.

---

Since the [[Manhattan Distance]] diagonal of a square is the same length as the side, you can imagine a diagonal all the way from the Pawn to the end of the board, and form a square with it. If the King can reach inside this square, that means he will catch the Pawn. If he cannot, that means he cannot catch it.
