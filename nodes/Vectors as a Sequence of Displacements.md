# Vectors as a Sequence of Displacements

An intuitive way to think about [[Vector]] coordinates and displacements is to imagine splitting the vector into a sequence of displacements.

---

For example, in 3D space, the displacement of `<3, -5, 1>` is a direct path from the origin to the destination. But to build intuition, one can think of it as a sequence of moves: move `3` units to the right, then move `5` units down, then move `1` unit forward. The end result is the same destination.
