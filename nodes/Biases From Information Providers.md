# Biases From Information Providers

It's very hard to consume just the essence of information without also taking in the biases of whoever provides it.

Even if you try hard to stay neutral, over time you'll probably start leaning toward the provider's opinions. Or if you fight against that too hard, you might overcorrect and go the opposite way - which still isn't neutral.

If you want to understand things and form your own views, the best way is to get raw data itself. Then you can decide for yourself, right or wrong.
