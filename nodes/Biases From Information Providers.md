# Biases From Information Providers

It's very difficult to consume the sententia of some information without also consuming the biases of the provider of the information.

Even if you try very hard to be neutral, given enough time, you will probably lean towards the opinions of the information provider. Or if you try hard to prevent that, you may overcompensate and go against him, in the opposite direction, which is still not nautral.

If you wish to know things and build your own viewpoint and biases, I guess the ideal way to consume information is just raw data itself. Then you are free to make your own choice, right or wrong.
