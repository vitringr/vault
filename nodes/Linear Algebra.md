# Linear Algebra

Branch of [[Mathematics]] that studies [[Vector Space]] and linear operations.

Linear algebra provides a fundamental framework for describing lines, planes, and higher-dimensional spaces, as well as the rules for manipulating objects within them.

## Concepts

**[[Vector]]**: The fundamental object of study, representing multidimensional quantities that can have both magnitude and direction, and can exist in any finite number of dimensions.

**[[Vector Space]]**: Formal environment for vectors and their operations, governed by a set of axioms.

**[[Linear Combination]]**: The primary method for constructing new vectors. It is the sum of [[Scalar]] multiples of other vectors.

**[[Span (Linear Algebra)]]**: The set of all possible vectors that can be formed as linear combinations of a given set of input vectors.

**[[Basis Vectors]]**: Set of linearly independent vectors whose span is the entire vector space. The number of basis vectors is the dimension of the space. Basis vectors define a [[Coordinate System]] for a vector space. Any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

**[[Linear Transformation]]**: Function that maps vectors from one vector space to another while preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

**[[Matrix]]**: Rectangular array of numbers that can represent linear transformations and vectors. [[Matrix Multiplication]] is defined specifically to perform linear transformation on a vector.

**[[Linear Equation]]**: A linear equation represents a line, plane, or hyperplane. A [[System of Equations|system of linear equations]] asks for their intersection points.

**[[Determinant]]**: Scalar value computed from a square matrix that provides critical information about a linear transformation, such as whether it is invertible and how it scales the area/volume of space.

**[[Linear Independence]]**:
