Linear Algebra provides a fundamental framework for describing lines, planes, and higher-dimensional spaces, as well as the rules for manipulating objects within them.



## Concepts

**[[Vector]]**: The fundamental object of study, representing multidimensional quantities that can have both magnitude and direction, and can exist in any finite number of dimensions.

**[[Vector Space]]**:

**[[Basis Vectors]]**:
**[[Linear Transformation]]**:
**[[Linear Equation]]**:
**[[System of Equations]]**:
**[[Determinant]]**:
**[[Matrix]]**:
