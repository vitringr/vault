# Linear Algebra

Branch of [[Mathematics]] that studies [[Vector Space]] and linear operations.

---

Linear algebra provides a fundamental framework for describing lines, planes, and higher-dimensional spaces, as well as the rules for manipulating objects within them.

## Concepts

**[[Vector]]**: The fundamental object of study, representing multidimensional quantities that can have both magnitude and direction, and can exist in any finite number of dimensions.

**[[Vector Space]]**: Formal environment for vectors and their operations, governed by a set of axioms.

**[[Basis Vectors]]**: Set of vectors that define a [[Coordinate System]] for a vector space. Any vector in the space can be expressed as a [[Linear Combination]] of the basis vectors.

**[[Linear Transformation]]**: Function that maps vectors from one vector space to another while preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

**[[Matrix]]**: Rectangular arrays of numbers that can represent linear transformations and vectors.
