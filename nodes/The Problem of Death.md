# The Problem of Death

Imagine you have to design an artificial world, full of artificial life, to the best of your abilities.

How would you design it? What rules would govern it? What patterns would it create?

**Computers**: This does not necessarily have to be a hypothetical question, as in this age we have the tools to create such worlds - computers. One can create a computer simulation that follows arbitrary rulesets designed by him.

**Goals**: For the sake of argument, your artificial world needs to achieve these two goals:

- **Autonomy**: Your world needs to be autonomous and self-sufficient.
- **Intelligence**: The purpose of your world is to achieve intelligence, or something greater, as a result of that intelligence.

So lets think about world-building.

**Generative Design**: Since your world needs to be autonomous, meaning that you can't be there forever to manipulate it, then it should probably follow generative design principles. The basic idea is to predefine a set of parameters, and then witness how meaningful patterns begin to emerge out of the chaos. Those emerging patterns have the potential to create life. Life has the potential to evolve. And that should be able to handle the intelligence goal.
