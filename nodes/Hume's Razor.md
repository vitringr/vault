# Hume's Razor

Causes must be sufficiently able to produce the effect assigned to them.

If a claim cannot be observed or demonstrated, it should be dismissed.

> If the cause, assigned for any effect, be not sufficient to produce it, we must either reject that cause, or add to it such qualities as will give it a just proportion to the effect.
>
> \- David Hume
