## Additions

**General Intellectual Category**: It's a label for a type of person—the thinker, the learned one—much like the English word "philosopher" or "sage."

**Classical Philosophers**: When Snorri Sturluson or the translators of the Kings' Sagas used spekingr, they were often referring to pre-Christian Greek and Roman thinkers like Socrates, Plato, Seneca, and Cicero. These were figures revered for their reason and ethical systems, not for a specific religion.
