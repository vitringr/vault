# Pin (Chess)

When a piece is under attack and cannot move without exposing another to the same attack.

---

**Absolute Pin**: An absolute pin is when the attacked piece is pinned to its King, and cannot legally move.

**Piling Up**: You can take advantage of a pinned piece that is unable to move by bringing in more and/or less valuable attackers for the exchange.
