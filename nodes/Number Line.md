# Number Line

Graphical representation of a one-dimensional coordinate system of numbers.

---

Each point on the line corresponds to a unique number, with equal intervals between consecutive integers.

**Infinite**: The line can extend to infinity in both the positive or negative direction.

The numbers are visually laid out on a straight horizontal line.
