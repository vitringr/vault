# Best

**Smith & Wesson Model 686**

(L-Frame, .357 Magnum)

Every source states it's the best model out there.

# Death as Universal Design

Death might be a necessary universal design.

What's the alternative to it?

What about violence and competition?

Maybe it's a necessary evolutionary principle so that strength can be gained.
