# Enso Drawing

Continuous Enso from the Regeneration draw.

Make it a cyclic circle that draws the Enso forever.

Would be cool for the middle of the website or something.

Can be made into a continuous logo, maybe smaller and optimized.

# Death as Universal Design

Death might be a necessary universal design.

What's the alternative to it?

Like if you have a system consisting of immortal but also replicating being... it can get messy.

What about violence and competition?

Maybe it's a necessary evolutionary principle so that strength can be gained.
