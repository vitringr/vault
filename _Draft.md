D B seems cool tbh

And it has the MEANING

Maybe move books to a `resources/` directory? Or something not to clutter the string search space, or at least make it known where it comes from.

Tim Ruswick:

Prototype hard. Not only one thing, but many, and keep them fast and simple.

Don't chase trends. Make the game you want to play.

Do one thing really really well instead of trying to do everything.

Mechanics & Fun > Realism.

Aesthetic Style > Graphics

- (good color palettes and stuff)

Focus on the front. Everyone plays the start, but not everyone finishes a game.

Get HONEST feedback.

- Problems they say are usually good, but solutions they say are usually not.
- Make sure the people are interested in the genre!

Specific software architecture doesn't really work lol.

Do not look too far ahead.

Explore and Lock.

Just explore and write code without thinking about the encompassing structure too much.

Software architecture is not really architecture as a blueprint, as this is basically what programming itself is. If "architecture" is supposed to produce a blueprint that is sufficient enough to explain how the program works, then this is actually the full code of the program itself.

Software architecture, in practice, is separation of code.

The purposes of separation:

- mental clarity, keeping things separate so you don't have to consider them at once
- code reuse
- division of labor

Not to have anyone step above you, but to be just, do not step on anyone then. Fair trade.

"It actually looks like im better at math on the screen than I actually am. Probably because I am covering things that I know really well. When I'm actually working out new math stuff it's atrocious. It's a disaster zone all the time."

- Reusable Game Modules
- Build Systems, Not Games
- Simulation vs View Separation

Learn fundaments well, use whatever tools to get the job done.
