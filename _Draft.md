Ventsi: "Most important for programming is simplicity"

The laws of nature are just the habits of the insignificant.

The giants of this world are not intrinsically large, only persistently small.
They are the stubborn repetition of the minimal until it becomes monumental.

The Paradox of Foundations

Mathematics, language, logic—all rest upon recursive structures. A definition depends on other definitions, which in turn depend on the first. A function calls itself, nesting deeper until it reaches a base case that was always implicit. This reveals a profound truth: that all systems, no matter how formal, ultimately rest upon self-reference. There is no final, unshakable ground—only the certainty that any foundation we name will eventually point back to itself.

Know that as is above, so is below.

If the universe is computational, as some speculate, then its program is written in recursion. 

The loop folds back upon itself, feeding its own existence.

The output becomes its own input.

The act of becoming alters the conditions of becoming.

What bends a branch also curves a mountain.

And so it unfolds. Again. Again. Again...
